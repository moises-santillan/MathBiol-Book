# The van der Pol Oscillator
 

**Abstract**

Oscillatory phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and underlie diverse biological and physical processes. The van der Pol oscillator introduced by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926 established a seminal mathematical framework for describing self-sustained oscillations that arise via a distinctive relaxation mechanism. This chapter analyzes the dynamical properties of the van der Pol oscillator through analytical and qualitative techniques. We derive the governing equation of motion from first principles using a spring-mass analog and examine its behavior both near and far from equilibrium. Through linearization and phase plane analysis, we classify oscillation regimes and determine stability properties of steady states. We also relate the system's dynamics to physiologically relevant relaxation oscillations in excitable media like cardiac tissue. Overall, the chapter establishes the van der Pol oscillator as a foundational model exhibiting nonlinear relaxation phenomena of widespread relevance across science and engineering disciplines.

## Introduction
Oscillators have widespread applications in science and engineering. In the early 20th century, the field of telecommunications faced the challenge of developing self-sustained oscillators capable of powering wireless communication over long distances. Pioneering researchers experimented with resistor-capacitor-inductor (RCL) circuits and introduced amplifiers to counteract energy losses and enable sustained oscillations. However, a more rigorous understanding of these oscillator systems was needed to facilitate their further development and practical applications.

In 1926, the Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol made seminal progress in this area with his oscillator model. Van der Pol recognized that amplifiers behave as negative resistors at low oscillation amplitudes, effectively amplifying signals. In an ideal system, an amplifier could then induce ever-growing oscillations by substituting the resistor in an RCL circuit. However, van der Pol also realized that unbounded growth was not observed in practice, suggesting the presence of a mechanism curtailing growth.

To address this, van der Pol introduced a model term that mimicked an amplifier at low amplitudes but behaved like a resistor at high amplitudes, limiting oscillation growth. Through analyzing this model, van der Pol demonstrated that under certain parameters, self-sustained oscillations could arise via a distinctive ``relaxation-type" behavior. This conceptualization of relaxation oscillations was highly influential.

Importantly, van der Pol also recognized the relevance of his model to describing the rhythmic electrical activity underlying cardiac pacemaker cells. He developed related models to simulate cardiac arrhythmias, providing novel insights.

In this chapter, we will explore the oscillatory dynamics of van der Pol's system. Studying this model aims to deepen understanding of engineered and biological self-oscillators exhibiting relaxation phenomena.

## The van der Pol model
To build his model, van der Pol substituted the linear damping term in the harmonic oscillator equation with a nonlinear term, as follows:
$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} - \mu(1 - x^2) \frac{dx}{dt} + x = 0.
$$

The key feature of this model is the nonlinear term $-\mu(1-x^2)$, which mimics the behavior of an amplifier at low amplitudes (when $|x|<1$) but acts like a resistor at high amplitudes (when $|x|>1$). The parameter $\mu$ controls the strength of the nonlinear damping. When $\mu = 0$, the system reduces to the standard harmonic oscillator. However, for nonzero $\mu$, the nonlinear damping term gives rise to richer dynamical behavior that will be explored in later sections. Specifically, as $\mu$ increases, the system exhibits oscillations that converge to a stable, finite-amplitude closed orbit called a \textit{limit cycle}.

It is insightful to rewrite the model as a system of first-order differential equations. Here, we apply the Liénard transformation $y = x - x^3/3 - \dot{x}/\mu$, which yields:
```{math}
:label: eq:19.01
\dot{x}  = \mu \left( x - \frac{x^3}{3} - y\right), 
```

```{math}
:label: eq:19.02
\dot{y}  = \frac{1}{\mu} x. 
```

This formulation enables analysis techniques like phase plane analysis, which provide insight into the limit cycle behavior. Specifically, we can examine the nullclines and flow field to understand how oscillations converge to the stable limit cycle trajectory.

## Steady State and Stability Analysis
To analyze the dynamics of the van der Pol oscillator, we first investigate its steady state behavior (recall that at the steady state, both derivatives $\dot{x}$ and $\dot{y}$ are equal to zero). It is insightful to examine the concept of nullclines in this analysis. A nullcline is defined as the set of points where one of the time derivatives is equal to zero, while the other is allowed to vary. For the van der Pol system, the $x$-nullcline consists of the points where $\dot{x}=0$, which corresponds to $y=x-x^3/3$ based on Eq. {eq}`eq:19.01`. The $y$-nullcline consists of the points where $\dot{y}=0$, given by $x=0$ from Eq. {eq}`eq:19.02`.

By definition, steady states occur at the intersection of both nullclines. Evaluating the nullclines for the van der Pol system, we find that they intersect only at the origin, with coordinates $(x,y) = (0,0)$. Therefore, this point represents the lone steady state, or fixed point, of the system. Fig. {ref}`fig:19.01` illustrates the nullclines and this fixed point.

To analyze stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix $\mathbf{J}$ of the system and evaluate it at the fixed point. The Jacobian of the 2-dimensional van der Pol model is given by:
$$
\mathbf{J} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{rr}
    \mu (1 - x^2) & -\mu \\
    1/\mu & 0
\end{arrat}
\right].
$$

Evaluating at the fixed point yields
$$
\mathbf{J} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{ll}
    \mu & -\mu & 
    1/\mu & 0
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Its eigenvalues and eigenvectors are:
$$
\lambda_{1,2}  = \frac{\mu \pm \sqrt{\mu^2 - 4}}{2}.
$$

$$
\vec{v}_{1,2}  = \left( \mu \frac{\mu \pm \sqrt{\mu^2 - 4}}{2}, 1 \right)^T
$$

Observe that the eigenvalues are either complex conjugate with positive real part or real positive numbers. In either case, the fixed point is locally unstable: a spiral in the first case and a node in the second. In the particular case in which $\mu \gg 2$, $\lambda_1 \gg \lambda_2$, whereas the first component of $\vec{v}_1$ is much greater than the second component of the same vector and both components of $\vec{v}_2$. This means that all trajectories starting in the neighborhood of the steady state will tend to rapidly move away in a direction almost parallel to the $x$ axis.

## Existence of a limit cycle
Fig. {ref}`fig:19.02` illustrates the phase portraits of the van der Pol system for different values of the parameter $\mu$, overlaid with the nullclines. As seen, trajectories far from the origin converge to the $x$-nullcline and for a while move along it in the direction of the steady state, in accordance with Eq. {eq}`eq:19.02`. Meanwhile, the unstable nature of the fixed point causes nearby trajectories to repel outwards. According to the Poincaré-Bendixon theorem, the only closed trajectory consistent with these opposing dynamics within a bounded region of phase space is a stable closed orbit, known as a limit cycle.

In contrast to a center equilibrium, there is no family of closed trajectories surrounding the fixed point here. Moreover, after a perturbation, trajectories return to the limit cycle if it is stable, or diverge from it if unstable. Critically, the emergence of a limit cycle implies the existence of a periodic solution---with trajectories repeating their motion indefinitely along the closed orbit. This periodic behavior explains the self-sustained oscillations exhibited by the van der Pol and similar relaxation oscillator systems.

## Relaxation Oscillations
In the limit where $\mu \rightarrow \infty$, additional insights can be gained about trajectory behavior in the van der Pol system. According to Eq. {eq}`eq:19.02`, flows are nearly horizontal everywhere except in close proximity to the $x$-nullcline. This is evident in the right panel of Fig.~{ref}`fig:19.02`, which shows trajectories rapidly approaching one of the lateral branches of the $x$-nullcline.

Once a trajectory lands on a lateral branch, it slowly creeps in the vertical direction---descending along the left branch or ascending the right branch. However, when the trajectory reaches a local maximum or minimum of the lateral branch, where it meets the unstable middle branch of the $x$-nullcline, it is unable to continue progressing along the middle branch. Instead, it abruptly jumps to the opposite lateral branch. Specifically, a trajectory descends the left branch until the local minimum, at which point it cannot progress further and abruptly jumps rightward to ascend the rising right branch instead. Similarly, upon reaching the local maximum of the right branch, the trajectory jumps left to descend along the left branch once more.

This rapid approach and slow movement along the stable branches, interrupted by abrupt jumps between branches at turning points, gives rise to the characteristic relaxation oscillations observed in the van der Pol oscillator when $\mu \gg 2$. The system alternates between episodes of rapid evolution and sluggish progression as it repeatedly hops between the lateral branches of the $x$-nullcline. This peculiar oscillatory behavior distinguishes relaxation oscillators from conventional sinusoidal oscillations.

## Discussion
In this chapter, we have introduced and analyzed the dynamics of the van der Pol oscillator. This model, developed by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, marked the first appearance of the concept of relaxation oscillations in physics and mathematics. By incorporating a nonlinear damping term into the harmonic oscillator equation, van der Pol was able to capture a peculiar oscillatory phenomenon characterized by alternating episodes of rapid change and slow progression between stable solutions.

The relaxation oscillations exhibited by the van der Pol system in the limit of large damping parameter $\mu$ distinguishes it fundamentally from conventional harmonic motion. This characteristic oscillatory behavior arises from the system's tendency to rapidly approach one lateral branch of the $x$-nullcline before abruptly switching to the other branch at local extremes.

Historically, the van der Pol oscillator played a pivotal role in conceptualizing relaxation oscillations and establishing them as a unique class of self-sustained oscillation distinct from sinusoidal waveforms. Beyond applications in electronics and engineering, van der Pol recognized the potential relevance of relaxation dynamics to biological oscillators underlying rhythmic processes in living organisms.

Indeed, relaxation-type oscillations provide insightful analogies for cyclic behaviors across disciplines. In neuroscience, they have helped quantify electrical spiking patterns in excitable cells like neurons. In cardiovascular physiology, relaxation oscillations resemble pressure-volume loops associated with the heartbeat.

By deriving the first model exhibiting relaxation oscillations, van der Pol laid foundations not only for oscillator theory but also quantitative modeling applications to biological rhythms. The ubiquitous nature of relaxation phenomena continues motivating research at the intersections of physics, engineering, mathematics and the life sciences.
