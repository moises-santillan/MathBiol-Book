# Introduction

This book was written for the interdisciplinary classroom I teach—graduate students whose backgrounds range from medicine to mathematics. Finding no single text that matched the needs of such a diverse group, I selected a focused set of topics that introduce mathematical thinking through biological questions, and wrote this book to fill that gap.

The approach is deliberately iterative: each chapter begins with a clear biological question and then introduces the minimal mathematical tools required to analyze it. We start with population dynamics because its concepts are intuitive to students from the exact sciences, and then broaden the canvas to topics such as electrophysiology and chemical kinetics to demonstrate the wide applicability of the same mathematical techniques. This structure is intended to build intuition alongside technical skill—students learn why a model is useful before learning how to build it.

I have also included short historical perspectives and vignettes about the development of key ideas. In my experience, these historical contexts motivate students and help them better grasp why particular concepts matter and how they arose in response to real scientific problems.

Whether you are a student seeking a first rigorous introduction to mathematical biology or an instructor looking for a compact course text, this book is designed to be accessible, adaptable, and practical: you will encounter clear problems, worked mathematical tools, and exercises aimed at building modeling confidence and insight.
