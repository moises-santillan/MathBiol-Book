# The FitzHugh-Nagumo Model
 

**Abstract**

This chapter introduces the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, a two-variable representation of excitable dynamics. We begin by reviewing the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the neuronal action potential, which provided the first quantitative description but was too complex for broader analysis. We then motivate the need for a simplified model that could capture key properties while facilitating mathematical insights. Next, we introduce the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations and analyze their fixed points and nullclines. Through linear stability analysis and examination of phase plane portraits, we demonstrate how the system can generate self-sustained oscillations via a stable limit cycle. We show that these oscillations qualitatively reproduce the spike-and-wave behavior of excitable systems through relaxation oscillations. Finally, we discuss how the FitzHugh-Nagumo model established an important conceptual and mathematical framework for investigating fundamental principles of excitability and excitation waves in a computationally simpler setting than previous approaches.

## Introduction
Early models of cell excitability focused on reproducing the qualitative spiking behavior of the action potential. The van der Pol oscillator provided a simple representation of self-sustained oscillations in autoexcitable systems like the heart. However, it did not account for the distinct properties of neurons and other excitable cells that require an external stimulus to trigger an action potential.

A breakthrough came with the Hodgkin-Huxley model in the 1950s. Through pioneering experimental and theoretical work, Hodgkin and Huxley developed the first quantitatively accurate model of neuronal excitation. They showed that action potentials result from non-linear interactions between voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels and membrane potential. This established the foundations of computational neuroscience and quantitative modeling of excitable cells.

However, the Hodgkin-Huxley model is complex, with four non-linear differential equations and multiple voltage-dependent gating variables. This complexity limited analytical insights and computation. A simpler explanatory model was needed to better understand the general principles governing excitability and oscillatory behavior in nerve and muscle fibers.

In the early 1960s, FitzHugh and Nagumo independently developed minimal two-variable models of neuronal excitability that captured the essence of excitable dynamics while removing biochemical details. These ``reduced" models provided a mathematically tractable framework for analyzing properties like excitation thresholds and traveling waves.

The goal of this chapter is to introduce the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and analyze its dynamics. We will derive its equations, examine fixed points and oscillations, and discuss its applications to diverse excitable systems. The FitzHugh-Nagumo model established a new paradigm for conceptualizing excitability and remains influential for its insights into universal organizing principles of excitable media.

## The Hodgkin-Huxley Model
The Hodgkin-Huxley model, developed in the 1950s, profoundly transformed the field of neuroscience. Prior to it, neuronal signaling was conceptualized in an oversimplified binary framework, with neurons considered to either fire an action potential or remain inactive. Hodgkin and Huxley shattered this notion by quantifying the ionic underpinnings of excitation. They established that the action potential results from finely coordinated ion movements, firmly establishing membrane biophysics as a quantitative discipline.

It is important to understand the historical context preceding this landmark achievement. In the 1930s, Cole and Curtis developed the voltage-clamp technique, permitting direct measurement of membrane ionic currents for the first time. This opened new insights into neural membrane properties. Further, Hodgkin made pioneering intracellular recordings of the action potential in squid giant axons in the late 1940s, providing new data but leaving the precise mechanisms unclear. Building on these foundations, Hodgkin joined efforts with Huxley at Cambridge University in the early 1950s. Through ingenious experimentation and quantitative modeling, they elucidated the molecular sequence of events underlying excitation. Their paired experimental and theoretical work effectively solved the mystery of how ions propagating an electrical signal across neural membranes.

Conceptually, Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the cell membrane as a capacitor separating two ionic solutions of differing concentration: the extracellular medium and the cytoplasm. To explain ion flux dynamics, they proposed the existence of transmembrane structures, now known as ion channels, that were selectively permeable to ions like sodium and potassium. critically, Hodgkin and Huxley hypothesized that these channels acted as variable resistors in parallel with the membrane capacitor.

Based on this ionic hypothesis, they developed the equivalent circuit diagram shown in Fig. :numref:`fig:20.01` to mathematically describe dynamic electric behavior in excitable cells. The governing equation for this circuit is:
$$
I = C_M \frac{dV_M}{dt} + g_{Na} (V_M - V_{NA}) + g_{K} (V_M - V_{K}) + g_{L} (V_M - V_{L}),
$$

where $I$ represents the total membrane current per unit area, $C_M$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_{Na}$ and $g_K$ are the sodium and potassium conductances, $V_{Na}$ and $V_K$ are the ion reversal potentials, and $g_L$ and $V_L$ characterize leak conductance and potential. The reversal potential is the membrane voltage at which net ion flow is zero. Ion flux results from electrochemical gradients comprising concentration differences and voltage potentials. At equilibrium, these counteracting forces balance and establish the reversal potential with no net ion movement. Leak currents, mediated by open leak channels permeable to ions like potassium, sodium and chloride, provide a small continuous current important for maintaining the resting potential.

In Figure :numref:`fig:20.01`, the sodium and potassium resistors are depicted as variable to model their voltage dependence. Hodgkin and Huxley postulated that each ion channel consists of several subunits that can individually transition between open and closed conformations. They proposed that the entire channel only conducts ions when all subunits adopt the open state. To mathematically represent this, Hodgkin and Huxley defined the sodium and potassium conductances as:
$$
g_{Na}  = \bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h,
$$

$$
g_K  = \bar{g}_K n^4.
$$

where $m$, $h$, and $n$ refer to the fraction of subunits in the open state for their respective channels. It was later discovered that voltage-gated sodium channels contain three identical subunits plus one distinct subunit, while potassium channels contain four identical subunits.

Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the dynamics of subunit conformational changes with:
$$
\frac{dm}{dt} = \alpha_m(V_M) (1-m) - \beta_m(V_M) m,
$$

$$
\frac{dn}{dt} = \alpha_n(V_M) (1-n) - \beta_n(V_M) n,
$$

$$
\frac{dh}{dt} = \alpha_h(V_M) (1-h) - \beta_h(V_M) h,
$$

where the transition rates $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ depend on membrane potential. For brevity, we omit Hodgkin and Huxley's specific functional forms for these rates.

## Motivation for Simplification
While the Hodgkin-Huxley model provided the first successful quantitative description of neuronal action potentials, its complexity also limited its utility for analyzing broader dynamical properties. The model contains four nonlinear differential equations involving several voltage-dependent gating variables. This made analytical insights into its behavior difficult to obtain.

Furthermore, implementing the Hodgkin-Huxley model numerically was computationally untractable at that time due to the need to resolve fast timescales of gating variable kinetics. There was thus a need for simpler models that could retain the essential feature of excitability while facilitating mathematical analysis and simulations. The goal was to distill the Hodgkin-Huxley model down to its bare conceptual minimum in order to understand general principles governing oscillatory and excitable phenomena in nerve and muscle fibers.

This motivated FitzHugh and Nagumo in the early 1960s to independently develop simplified two-variable models of neuronal excitability that abstracted away biochemical details. While less biophysically detailed, these minimal models opened new opportunities to investigate fundamental properties like limit cycles, thresholds for excitation, and traveling wave behaviors through qualitative analysis and simulation—paving the way for novel insights into neural and cardiac dynamics.

## Derivation of the FitzHugh-Nagumo Equations
The FitzHugh-Nagumo model was developed to capture the essential features of excitability in a simplified manner. FitzHugh drew inspiration from the van der Pol oscillator, which was known to reproduce properties of autoexcitable systems through a limit cycle behavior.

To mathematically represent neuronal excitability, FitzHugh modified the van der Pol framework such that the system's steady state could transition between stable and unstable regimes. He proposed a two-variable formulation involving a fast membrane potential variable $V$ and slower recovery variable $R$.

There is some flexibility in how the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is expressed mathematically. A common formulation considers the equations:
$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = f(V) - R + I,
$$

$$
\frac{dR}{dt} = \epsilon(\gamma V - R).
$$

The function $f(V)$ represents a cubic polynomial feedback for the variable $V$, which can take positive or negative values depending on the magnitude of $V$. This nonlinear feedback captures the regenerative dynamics underlying excitability. In this common formulation, the nonlinear feedback is defined as:
$$
f(V) = V (a - V) (V - b),
$$

with $a < b$. The small parameter $\epsilon \ll 1$ establishes a time scale separation between the fast variable $V$ and slower variable $R$. Physiologically, this reflects the separation between rapid membrane dynamics and slower cytoplasmic processes. Due to its slower time scale, $R$ provides negative feedback to $V$, mimicking neural recovery mechanisms that return the membrane potential to its resting level following excitation. Finally, the parameter $I$ acts as a constant input current, analogous to leak currents that determine the neuronal resting potential. Together, these features allow the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to reproduce the essential excitable spiking dynamics in a simplified mathematical framework. 

## Analysis of Steady States
To analyze the fixed points and their stability, we first find the nullclines of the system. For this system, the $V$-nullcline corresponds to points where $\dot{V}=0$, and the $R$-nullcline corresponds to points where $\dot{R}=0$. Through algebraic manipulation, these nullclines can be written as:
$$
R = f(V) + I,
$$

$$
R = \gamma V.
$$

These nullcline equations are plotted in Figure :numref:`fig:20.02` for parameter values $a=1$, $b=3$, $\gamma=2.2$, and three different values of the input current $I=0,1,2$. We see that when $I=0,1$, the cubic $V$-nullcline and linear $R$-nullcline intersect in the left branch of the cubic where $f'(V)<0$. In contrast, when $I=2$ the nullclines intersect in the middle portion where $f'(V)>0$.

When $I=0$ and $I=1$, the cubic $V$-nullcline intersects the linear $R$-nullcline in the left branch where $f'(V)<0$, yielding a stable fixed point. For $I=2$, the intersection occurs in the middle branch where $f'(V)>0$, producing an unstable fixed point.
```

Fixed points correspond to the intersections of the nullclines. To analyze their stability, we calculate the Jacobian matrix:
$$
J = $$
\begin{bmatrix}
        f'(V) & -1 
\epsilon \gamma & -\epsilon
        \end{bmatrix}
$$.
$$

All entries of the Jacobian are constant except for the term $f'(V)$, which changes sign depending on whether the nullcline intersection occurs in the left or middle branch of the cubic. 

The trace ($\tau$) and determinant ($\Delta$) of the Jacobian are:
$$
\tau = f'(V) - \epsilon, \quad \Delta = \epsilon (\gamma - f'(V))
$$

The stability of the fixed points depends on the signs of the Jacobian trace, $\tau$, and determinant, $\Delta$. Specifically, if $f'(V)<0$, the fixed point is stable with $\tau<0$ and $\Delta>0$. When the condition $\epsilon<f'(V)<\gamma$ is satisfied instead, the fixed point becomes an unstable node or spiral, characterized by $\tau>0$ and $\Delta>0$. Physiologically, we expect the parameter $\epsilon$ governing the timescale of recovery variable $R$ to be much smaller than 1, since $R$ represents a slower process than the membrane dynamics of $V$. This is consistent with the condition $\epsilon<f'(V)$.

In the following section, we will conduct a phase plane analysis to show that when the fixed point is unstable, it lies within a stable limit cycle orbit. This limit cycle behavior underlies the oscillations exhibited by excitable systems modeled by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations.

## Phase Plane Analysis
When the fixed point of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system is unstable, its trajectory will not remain in the vicinity of the fixed point. In a small neighborhood of the unstable fixed point, the system is topologically equivalent to its linearization. Since both eigenvalues of the Jacobian have positive real parts, all trajectories will flow outward from the fixed point. We can also see in figure :numref:`fig:20.03` that trajectories far from the origin converge to the $V$-nullcline to then approach the fixed point. We can apply the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem to show that all trajectory must converge to a limit cycle. The phase space of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system is the plane, which has no singular points. Furthermore, the vector field describing the system is continuous and smooth. Therefore, by the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, any bounded non-wandering trajectory in the plane must asymptotically approach a fixed point or a limit cycle. However, the only fixed point is unstable, so trajectories cannot approach it. The bounded trajectories must therefore converge to a periodic orbit, namely a stable limit cycle.

## Relaxation oscillator behavior
When the parameter $\gamma$ governing the time scale of the recovery variable $R$ is small ($\gamma \ll 1$), the FitzHugh-Nagumo model exhibits relaxation oscillation dynamics. In the phase plane portrait shown in Figure :numref:`fig:20.04`, the intersection of the nullclines occurs along the middle branch of the cubic curve, where the slope $f'(x) < 0$, rendering the fixed point unstable. This instability positions the system within the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle.

To understand the trajectory of the limit cycle oscillation, we can examine the vector field flow. When the system is near the left cubic branch, the vector field points sharply to the right, rapidly driving the trajectory upward along the branch. This corresponds to the swift rise of the membrane potential toward its peak value during an action potential. Once the trajectory crosses the cubic branch at its local maximum, the vector field reverses direction, sharply pointing leftward. This causes a rapid decline in the membrane potential as it descends along the left branch. Meanwhile, the recovery variable $R$ continues to move slowly leftward along its linear branch due to its longer timescale ($\gamma \ll 1$).

Eventually, $R$ pulls the trajectory below the cubic branch at a local minimum. At this juncture, the vector field reverses again, and the membrane potential begins a slow ascent along the right cubic branch as $R$ decreases. This gradual motion along the branch represents the extended falling phase and undershoot period of a relaxation oscillation. Consequently, the limit cycle trajectory alternates between rapid excursions along the lateral cubic branches, representing the spike phases, and slower movements along the branches during the falling and recovery phases. This oscillatory behavior closely mimics the characteristic relaxation oscillations observed in autoexcitable systems, such as the van der Pol oscillator and cardiac pacemaker cells.

## Applications to Excitable Systems
While initially developed as a simplified model of neuronal action potentials, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is universal in its ability to reproduce the core properties of excitable and autoexcitable systems. Through variations in its parameter values, it can replicate important behaviors observed experimentally across diverse excitable cell and medium types.

In neurons, changes in the applied current $I$ allow the model to transition between quiescence at low $I$ and repetitive spiking at higher $I$ above a threshold, closely mimicking rheobase properties. Varying the recovery time scale $\epsilon$ alters spike frequencies, qualitative matching adaptation properties seen in neuronal firing patterns.

In cardiac tissue, decreasing $\epsilon$ slows oscillation periods, akin to effects of slowing heart rates via vagus nerve stimulation. Altering excitability parameters $a,b$ reproduces changes in action potential shape seen with altered ion channel expression levels. Propagating wavefronts of activity in the two-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo model with spacial coupling emulate cardiac conduction.

Even in non-biological chemical and physical systems, the model applies. Light-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions and lipid bilayers are autoexcitable, supported by the phase plane framework through a supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation as a control parameter is varied. Self-igniting flames and autocatalytic surface reactions behave as subexcitable media between quiescent and oscillatory phases.

Overall, the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations provide a versatile mathematical description illuminating universal organizing principles for excitability. Its canonical form enables reduced computational requirements compared to detailed biophysical models while still faithfully reproducing qualitative phenomena across media exhibiting rapid switching between stable steady states. This makes it a mainstay for investigating general properties of excitability and excitation wave propagation.

## Discussion
In this chapter, we introduced the FitzHugh-Nagumo model as a simplified two-variable representation of neuronal excitability. While far more abstract than the original Hodgkin-Huxley formulation, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model effectively distills the essential features of excitable dynamics down to their conceptual minimum.

Through its formulation as a fast-slow system with a cubic nonlinearity and recovery variable, the FitzHugh-Nagumo model can reproduce the hallmark electrical spiking behavior of neurons in a qualitatively accurate manner. Analysis of its nullclines and fixed point stability provided insight into how subthreshold oscillations arise via a supercritical Andronov-Hopf bifurcation.

Examination of the model's phase plane portraits and vector field flows demonstrated its ability to generate relaxation oscillations, closely mimicking the characteristic spike-and-wave profile of excitable membranes. This oscillatory behavior emerges from a stable limit cycle attracted to when the fixed point loses stability.

Importantly, simulations and applications to diverse excitable media indicated the FitzHugh-Nagumo model captures universal organizing principles, not just details specific to neurons. It provides a computationally simpler framework than biophysical models while still faithfully replicating qualitative excitable phenomena.

Overall, the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations established a new paradigm for conceptualizing and mathematically investigating excitability. Their development illuminated fundamental properties of excitable systems and excitation wave propagation in a more tractable setting than earlier approaches. This makes the FitzHugh-Nagumo model highly influential as a foundational tool for studying excitation across many fields.

## Exercises
1. Numerically solve the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and plot the solutions in the phase plane, including the system's nullclines. Explore various parameter sets and confirm that the behavior aligns with that of excitable cells when the fixed point is stable and $\epsilon \gg 0$. Specifically, demonstrate that an action potential occurs whenever the initial condition lies to the right of the middle branch of the cubic nullcline.
  
    1. A phase response curve (PRC) is a tool used to analyze the timing of action potentials in oscillatory systems. It describes how the timing of a subsequent spike is affected by perturbations (e.g., small inputs) at different phases of the oscillation cycle. In this exercise, you will compute and plot the phase response curve for the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model under parameters that cause it to behave as a relaxation oscillator.
