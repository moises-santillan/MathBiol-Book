It categorizes models from living organisms to mathematical equations, analyzing their purposes and limitations as simplified representations that distill complexity. Key principles are explored, establishing that models are strategic idealizations rather than perfect replicas, requiring skill in productive simplification. Models are framed as epistemic tools that generate hypotheses and organize empirical research to iteratively refine theories over time through explanatory or predictive functions. By synthesizing these philosophical underpinnings, the chapter conveys modeling as a balance between art and science that sustains open-ended scientific progress through provisional frameworks and evolving abstraction informed by empirical evidence.","type":"content","url":"/ch01","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.

Whether it is cells, climate or evolution of life, the phenomena investigated involve countless interacting components operating across multiple scales. To address such complexity, scientists employ models that are simplified representations aimed at distilling the key features of the system under study, while ignoring less important details. Models take diverse forms, ranging from living organisms and physical constructions to mathematical equations and conceptual diagrams. Despite their different representations, all models seek to condense complexity into forms comprehensible to the human mind.\n\nThe development of models is fundamental in several scientific disciplines. Among other applications, models facilitate hypothesis testing and theoretical development when direct experimentation is difficult. It could even be argued that scientific theories themselves are models that provide simplified frameworks for explaining and predicting natural phenomena.\n\nThis chapter explores the conceptual foundations and functions of modeling in science. It details the various types of model and investigates their philosophical foundations.

Since they involve living organisms, these models capture the inherent systemic complexity of life that cannot be replicated through other types of models.\n\nLiving models offer benefits such as allowing the study, under controlled conditions and in a longitudinal way, of dynamic and complex biological processes such as development, physiology and the progression of diseases. This allows understanding such processes in the functional multisystemic context of the living organism. Likewise, animal testing enables pre-clinical evaluation of drug efficacy, safety and optimal dosing regimens before clinical trials with human subjects. This ensures, as far as possible, the protection of health and well-being of participants in human research.\n\nHowever, they also have certain limitations. The inherent complexity of living organisms makes it difficult to isolate and study individual molecular or physiological variables, making it difficult to establish direct cause-effect links. In addition, biological differences between species require extrapolating animal data to humans, as not all disease mechanisms can be directly comparable due to evolutionary divergence.\n\nIn summary, while offering a more holistic approximation of human biology, or biology of species of commercial interest, than other models, they must be evaluated according to intrinsic limitations and ethical factors, to ensure they continue to significantly contribute to advances in biomedicine.","type":"content","url":"/ch01#living-organisms-as-models","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.

Their practical nature facilitates visualization and conceptualization of abstract biomolecular organizations. This interactive characteristic inspires new hypotheses and experiments as researchers manipulate the replicas.

These ideas emphasize that models avoid being perfect replicas to become manageable representations of the systems under study.\n\nThe goal is thus abstraction through which the essential is condensed in simplified constructions cognizable. Modeling seeks to reveal the essence beneath through idealization, not mere imitation of details. This could be summarized in George Box’s following statement: “Although all models are wrong, some prove useful.” The standard is not strict precision but the ability to shed light on scientific questions through strategic abstraction and simplification.","type":"content","url":"/ch01#models-as-idealizations","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"1.

Phillips distinguishes between errors of idealization, by omitting non-essential factors, and objective errors, by mis-characterizing the phenomenon. The former may be acceptable if they do not affect the model’s functions; the latter are less permissible.\n\nThe test of simplifications lies in whether they support models’ understanding and predictive capacity more than strict similarity to reality.

Progress will depend on interaction between simplification, experimentation and iterative theoretical refinement.\n\nModels ensure that scientific inquiry remains an empirical, mentally open process. By establishing provisional understandings, they invite dialogue and extension of theories in the face of emergent realities.

To adequately study and understand evolving phenomena, appropriate mathematical tools are needed to describe systems and their evolution over time. Differential equations provide just such a framework, allowing the representation of natural processes in terms of rates of change.\n\nSpecifically, differential equations relate the derivative of an unknown variable to functions of that variable and/or independent variables. For instance:\\frac{dy}{dx}  =  f(x),\\frac{dy}{dx}  =  f(x,y),\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_1} + \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x_2}  =  f(y, x_1, x_2).\n\nEqs. \n\n(1) and \n\n(2) involve a single unknown variable and are called ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

Often, differential equations admit multiple solution functions, collectively called a family of solutions. However, real-world systems are uniquely defined by their initial state. By specifying an initial condition, the problem becomes an initial value problem. This additional information allows narrowing down the family of solutions to a single, unique solution corresponding to the system’s behavior over time.

Modeling involves more than just solving equations—it is a complete process. The first step is to develop a mathematical model through formulation of governing equations that describe the key aspects of the system or problem. Crafting an appropriate model requires balance, as models need to be sufficiently simple to analyze while still accurately representing the phenomenon. Once established, models are used to gain insights through mathematical and analytical techniques rather than just obtaining numeric solutions. Critically, the results must then be interpreted by relating the mathematical abstractions back to the real system. This contextualization provides enhanced understanding and conclusions. Moreover, answering questions through modeling often leads to new questions, thereby driving development of improved or new models in an iterative process. The overarching goal of mathematical modeling is to complement empirical studies by mechanistically linking mathematics to observed natural phenomena.\n\nAs an example of the mathematical modeling process, consider the observable phenomenon of clouds remaining suspended in the sky despite being composed of water/ice; materials denser than air. Why do clouds not simply fall to the earth under the force of gravity given the density of their constituents?\n\nTo construct an initial model to investigate this question, we begin by abstracting the intricate, large-scale cloud system into its fundamental building blocks. Clouds are formed from innumerable minuscule droplets and particulates. Therefore, modeling the dynamics of a single representative component isolates the key issue while reducing overall complexity. This abstraction enables formulation of a simplified framework to theoretically explore the forces governing a single constituent’s behavior, providing insights into the large-scale behavior of clouds as aggregates of many such parts.\n\nAt the level of the individual droplet, the key elements governing its dynamics are the downward pulling force of gravity and the counteracting upward pushing force of air resistance opposing the droplet’s movement. Other complex cloud-scale phenomena are negligible for this preliminary model. Fig. \n\nFigure 1 provides a conceptual illustration of this abstracted perspective, visually depicting the isolated droplet subject to only two delineated forces via a diagrammatic force representation.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Diagrammatic force representation of a solitary descending water droplet (or ice particle), with the downward pointing weight and upward pointing air resistance delineated.\n\nConsider the positive axis directed along the weight vector. Then by Newton’s second law, we can write:ma = mg - F_r,\n\nwhere a is droplet acceleration, m its mass, g gravity, and F_r frictional air force. Assuming a spherical droplet, Stokes’ law for a sphere in a fluid gives F_r = 6\\pi \\mu rv, with \\mu the air viscosity, r the droplet radius, and v velocity. We can thus write F_r = \\eta v, where \\eta = 6\\pi \\mu r. Substituting into \n\n(7) and solving for \\dot{v} yields:\\dot{v} = \\frac{\\eta}{m} \\left( \\frac{mg}{\\eta} - v \\right).\n\nDefining \\tau = m/\\eta and v_T = mg/\\eta allows us to rewrite Eq. \n\n(8) as:\\dot{v} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} (v_T - v).\n\nApplying the method of separation of variables to Eq. \n\n(9) yields:\\int \\frac{1}{v - v_T} dv = \\int \\frac{-1}{\\tau} dt.\n\nIntegrating both sides gives:\\ln{(v - v_T)} = \\frac{-t}{\\tau} + C.\n\nSolving this for the velocity v produces:v = v_T + C e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}}.\n\nThe initial condition v(0) = v_0 gives:C = v_0-v_T.\n\nSubstituting this result provides the expression:v = v_T + (v_0 - v_T)e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}}.\n\nWhich describes the time evolution of the droplet’s velocity.\n\nTo understand the droplet’s velocity behavior over very long time periods, we calculate:\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} v = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\left[ v_T + (v_0 - v_T) e^{\\frac{-t}{\\tau}}\\right]= v_T.\n\nThis indicates that the droplets will eventually reach a terminal constant velocity of v_T. Fig. \n\nFigure 2 displays plots of Eq. \n\n(14) for differing initial velocities v_0 while holding \\tau fixed. Notice that all solutions converge to the common value of v_T, regardless of the initial conditions. This illustrates that droplets decelerate over time, eventually matching the characteristic falling speed v_T defined by fluid properties and gravitational acceleration.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Plots of the normalized particle velocity v(t)/v_T, given by Eq. \n\n(14), for different initial conditions, v_0.\n\nLet us further analyze the terminal velocity. Recall that v_T = mg/\\eta. However, we can express mass as m = V\\rho, where V is droplet volume and \\rho its density. Since the droplet is assumed spherical, substituting gives:v_T = \\frac{V\\rho g}{\\eta} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^{3} \\rho g}{6 \\pi \\mu r} = \\frac{2\\rho g}{9\\mu}r^{2},\n\nwhich reveals the final velocity is proportional to the square of the droplet radius. That is, larger droplets reach a higher terminal speed.\n\nLet us now explore the behavior of Eq. \n\n(14) for varying values of \\tau. Fig. \n\nFigure 3 displays plots of normalized particle velocity versus time for cases where \\tau/2, \\tau, and 2\\tau are considered, while holding v_0/v_T fixed. Notably, as \\tau increases, it takes longer for the droplet velocity to approach v_T. This observation leads us to identify \\tau as the relaxation time of the system, representing the duration required to reach equilibrium.\n\nTo investigate the rate at which the droplet velocity approaches v_T, let us examine \\tau = m/\\eta:\\tau = \\frac{m}{\\eta} = \\frac{V\\rho}{\\eta} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\rho}{6\\pi\\mu r} = \\frac{2}{9}\\frac{\\rho}{\\mu}r^2,\n\nOnce again, we find that \\tau is directly proportional to the square of the droplet radius. Therefore, larger droplets have longer relaxation times to attain their terminal velocity.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Plots of the normalized particle velocity v(t)/v_T, obtained from Eq. \n\n(14)\n\nThe above analysis provides insight into why microscopic droplets present in clouds do not readily fall under the force of gravity. Eq. \n\n(17) demonstrates that the relaxation time \\tau is directly proportional to the square of the droplet radius. Given typical cloud droplet sizes on the order of 10 \\mum, this results in relaxation times that are exceedingly short; on the order of milliseconds based on standard fluid properties.\n\nAccording to Eq. \n\n(14), these microscopic droplets would reach 99% of their terminal velocity v_T within a fraction of a second due to the ultra-fast relaxation timescale. However, for cloud droplet sizes, the associated terminal velocity v_T itself as given by Eq. \n\n(16) is minuscule, on the order of centimeters per second.\n\nTherefore, over observational timescales relevant to the human eye, micrometer-sized cloud droplets do not perceptibly change in velocity. This is a result of both the very small terminal velocities and exceedingly rapid approach to equilibrium velocity. Their behavior appears static, even though they are slowly descending owing to gravity.\n\nOnly larger droplets within clouds have observable terminal velocities and thus visibly fall. Coincidentally, this analysis helps explain the triggering of rain from clouds. Precipitation occurs through coalescence of multiple microscopic droplets into larger falling raindrops, encouraged by processes like droplet collisions, updrafts/downdrafts, cooling temperatures, and presence of foreign particles.","type":"content","url":"/ch02#modeling-the-fall-of-cloud-droplets","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

However, clouds exist within a dynamic atmospheric environment subjected to fluctuating air movements. To gain a more realistic perspective, let us now expand our model to include the effects of ambient wind forces.\n\nFig. \n\nFigure 4 displays a revised free body diagram depicting a single droplet experiencing an additional time-varying force f(t) imposed by surrounding air motions. Previously, the droplet equilibrium was determined by a balance between the constant downward pull of gravity and upwards drag resistance. With inclusion of f(t), the force budget acting on each droplet becomes more complex as transient lift/drag disturbances alter the net downward acceleration at any given instant. Modeling this third force offers opportunity to deepen understanding of cloud-scale behaviors emerging from interactions between falling constituent droplets and turbulent airflow fluctuations.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Free body diagram of a single falling droplet of water (or particle of ice). Pointing downwards the weight of the droplet and the force produced by an air current, and pointing upwards the resistance of the air.\n\nChoosing the vertical axis positive in the direction of gravitational acceleration, the equation of motion is:m\\dot{v} = mg + f(t) - \\eta v,\n\nwhere f(t) denotes the time-varying lift or drag imposed by surrounding winds. Let us define the total force acting on the droplet as F(t) = mg + f(t). Isolating the drag term in Eq. \n\n(18) yields:\\dot{v} = \\frac{\\eta}{m}\\left(\\frac{F(t)}{\\eta} - v\\right).\n\nConsistent with our prior analysis, we identify the relaxation time as \\tau = m/\\eta and the instantaneous terminal velocity as v_T(t) = F(t)/\\eta. Substituting these into Eq. \n\n(19) gives:\\dot{v} = \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\left(v_T(t) - v\\right) ,\n\nwhich has the same form when time-varying wind effects were not included on the droplet motion.\n\nOur previous analysis of the equation of motion without time-varying winds showed that the droplet velocity asymptotically approaches the constant terminal velocity v_T, independent of initial conditions. Additionally, we determined the relaxation time \\tau governs how rapidly this approach occurs.\n\nWhen extending our model to include time-varying winds inducing a transient terminal velocity v_T(t), similar behavior is expected for the droplet velocity v(t). Specifically, v(t) will tend towards the instantaneous value of v_T(t) at each moment in time. The rate at which v(t) adjusts to changes in the fluctuating v_T(t) is determined by the relaxation time \\tau.\n\nFor droplets experiencing fluctuations in v_T(t) due to winds, our prior analysis indicates that those with smaller \\tau will track variations in v_T(t) most closely over time. Within clouds, where droplet sizes yield relaxation times on the order of milliseconds, this property allows for rapid synchronization between v(t) and microscale variations in airflow velocity induced by turbulence.\n\nOn observable human timescales, this near-perfect tracking imposed by minute \\tau obscures individual droplet motions. Instead, clouds appear nebulous and suspended motionless despite droplets smoothly adjusting their velocities downward while also following transient atmospheric currents. Therefore, the small droplet sizes characteristic of clouds effectively couple velocities to instantaneous air movements, contributing significantly to their visual appearance.","type":"content","url":"/ch02#expanding-the-model-to-include-ambient-air-currents","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

We applied this approach to investigate the behavior of cloud droplets and why they do not visibly fall under gravity.\n\nThrough analytical modeling of a cloud droplet experiencing gravity, drag, and wind forces, we derived equations of motion and solved them to determine droplet velocity over time. This revealed that each droplet reaches a constant terminal settling velocity, v_T, irrespective of initial conditions.\n\nAnalysis of the model showed the scaling relationships of both v_T and relaxation time constant \\tau with droplet radius r. Specifically, we found v_T and \\tau are directly proportional to r^2. Given cloud droplet radii are on the micron scale, this results in two key properties:\n\nDroplets attain v_T extremely rapidly due to exceedingly short \\tau.\n\nThe actual magnitude of v_T is minuscule due to the r^2 scaling.\n\nTherefore, while droplets gradually descend at their slow terminal velocities, this imperceptible motion occurs below human observational resolution scales.\n\nAdditionally, ambient winds disrupting continuous descent contribute further to clouds’ static visual appearance. Overall, the mathematical modeling elucidated the underlying reasons clouds evade falling visibly despite gravitational forces acting on constituent droplets.\n\nEven simple mathematical models of natural phenomena, like the linear drag model developed here for cloud droplets, can provide deep insights into observable behaviors that may otherwise be taken for granted. By distilling relationships down to their essential mathematical elements, qualitative and quantitative predictions emerge regarding how underlying physical factors control system-level properties.\n\nThe rest of this book is dedicated to expanding on such modeling techniques, specifically through nonlinear dynamics approaches. Subsequent chapters will introduce nonlinear methods and apply them to study the time-evolving behavior of various biological systems. The overarching goal is to utilize analytical and computational nonlinear dynamics tools to elucidate the unexpectedly complex and sometimes counterintuitive dynamics that often arise in living systems due to nonlinear interactions between components.","type":"content","url":"/ch02#discussion","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"2.

This object is placed in an oven that maintains a constant temperature T_H. The rate of heat influx into the object is proportional to the difference between the oven temperature and the object’s current temperature. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as:J_Q = \\alpha (T_H - T),\n\nwhere T represents the temperature of the object at any given time. Additionally, the heat influx is related to the rate of change of the object’s temperature through the specific heat capacity C:J_Q = C \\frac{dT}{dt}.\n\nBy combining these two equations, derive the differential equation that describes the evolution of the object’s temperature T over time. After formulating the differential equation, discuss its solution in detail, focusing particularly on the concept of relaxation time, which characterizes how quickly the object approaches thermal equilibrium with the oven.\n\nConsider an electrical circuit in which a capacitor, with capacitance C, is connected to a voltage source V_S through a resistor R. Initially, the capacitor is uncharged, and the circuit is open. Since the resistor and capacitor are in series, the sum of the voltage drops across each component equals the source voltage:V_S = V_R + V_C\n\nHere, the current I flowing through both the resistor and the capacitor is the same. According to Ohm’s Law, the voltage drop across the resistor is given by:V_R = I R\n\nAdditionally, the relationship for the capacitor is described by:I = C \\frac{d V_C}{dt}\n\nTaking all of this into account, derive the differential equation for the voltage across the capacitor, V_C, once the circuit is closed.

He challenged the king to a game of chess because he loved playing it. Before the game started, they had to decide what the prize would be if the sage won. The sage said that he only wanted a small amount of rice, but the amount had to be calculated using a chessboard. A grain of rice would be placed in the first square and the number of rice grains would double for each successive square on the board. The king lost the game and had to give the sage the rice. But as he started putting the rice grains on the board, the king realized that he wouldn’t have enough rice to pay his debt. Krishna then showed himself in his true form and told the king that he didn’t have to pay all the rice right away, but he could do it gradually. Every day, the king would serve free rice pudding to people who came to the temple until the debt was paid off.\n\nThis story has different versions. In some versions, God Krishna is replaced by a servant, the inventor of chess, or a craftsman who makes the best chessboards. In others, rice is substituted by wheat. The ending is also different. In some versions, the ruler has the person who should get the reward killed, while in others, the reward is given only if each grain is counted individually. But the message stays the same: the explosive increase in a pattern where each step is multiplied by the same number (geometric progression) instead of just being added by the same amount (arithmetic progression).\n\nWith a history dating back to the Greeks and possibly even the Sumerians, geometric progressions---a discrete form of the exponential function---boasts a rich legacy. Despite this, it wasn’t until the 18th century, with the contribution of some of the world’s most renowned mathematicians, that the exponential function was finally uncovered. Nevertheless, its influence has been tremendous and spans across numerous scientific domains. A key milestone in this history is the creation of logarithms, which was a seminal event.\n\nIn this chapter we briefly review their history.

Despite Bürgi’s probable creation of his system around 1600, Napier’s discovery was published first in 1614 in the book Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description of the Wonderful Canon of Logarithms), making him widely known as the inventor of logarithms and greatly influencing its subsequent evolution.\n\nLogarithms establish a connection between the operation of multiplication on the positive real numbers and addition on the real number line. Napier, in particular, viewed logarithms as the relationship between two particles moving along a line---one at a constant speed, the other at a speed proportional to its distance from a fixed endpoint. In current terms, Napier’s logarithm (\\mathrm{NapLog}) can be related to the natural logarithm (\\ln) in this way:\\mathrm{NapLog}(x) = -10^7 \\ln(x / 10^7).\n\nEnglish mathematician Henry Briggs made two visits to Edinburgh to collaborate with John Napier in 1616 and 1617. During their conversations, they reached an agreement on Briggs’ proposed modification to Napier’s logarithms. After his second trip, Briggs released the first table of his improved logarithms, now known as common or base 10 logarithms (\\log_{10}), in 1617. The widespread use of common logarithms grew rapidly due to their ease in performing complex calculations during a time when calculators were not available. This was mainly due to the fact that our numbering system is built on powers of 10. Nevertheless, the natural logarithm holds a more prominent place in the history of mathematics because of its impact on the discipline’s evolution.\n\nIn 1649, Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa, who was previously a student of Grégoire de Saint-Vincent, demonstrated that the area A(t) of the region bounded by the hyperbola xy = 1 from x = 1 to x = t obeys the following relation common to all logarithmic function:A(t \\times u) = A(t) + A(u).\n\nIt was soon realized that this characteristic could lead to the creation of a new type of logarithm. Mercator, in fact, published the first tables of what is now referred to as the natural logarithm in his book Logaritmotechnia in 1668.","type":"content","url":"/ch03#the-invention-of-logarithms","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.

Prior to Euler, these mathematical concepts were usually defined using integral calculus. However, Euler changed this by introducing exponentiation a^x for constant a in the positive real numbers, leading to the creation of the logarithm to base a. He also named the natural logarithm, calling it the ``natural or hyperbolic logarithm\" due to its connection to the quadrature of the hyperbola. Euler designated number e as the base for the natural logarithm, i.e. the number whose natural logarithm is equal to 1.\n\nJacob Bernoulli’s groundbreaking work in compound interest paved the way for the discovery of the constant later named e by Euler. Bernoulli’s contribution can be succinctly described as follows: he examined the growth of capital when invested at an annual interest rate of 100% and is compounded at n intervals. At the end of the year, the capital would have multiplied by a factor of\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} \\right)^n.\n\nBernoulli showed that as the number of compounding intervals increases, this factor approaches a constant value between 2 and 3.\n\nEuler expanded upon Bernoulli’s work by defining the exponential and natural logarithmic functions as follows:\\exp(x)  = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right)^n\\ln(x)  = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n (x^{1/n} - 1).\n\nAdditionally, Euler established that the exponential function is a exponentiation function with base e (\\exp(x) = e^x) and that the exponential and logarithmic functions are inverse of each other.","type":"content","url":"/ch03#from-logarithms-to-the-exponential-function","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"3.

We define the function \\eta(\\tau, t) d\\tau as the fraction of individuals in the population with ages in the interval [\\tau, \\tau+d\\tau] at time t. This function fully describes the population state at any given time and how it evolves. Specifically, the total population at any time t is given by:N(t) = \\int_0^\\infty \\eta(\\tau', t) d\\tau'.\n\nIn the absence of births, deaths, and migration, individuals can only age over time. This means the plot of the function \\eta(\\tau, t) shifts to the right as time passes. We can mathematically express this as:\\eta(\\tau, t+\\Delta t) = \\eta(\\tau-\\Delta t, t).\n\nExpanding the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) terms in a Taylor series about t and \\tau, respectively, gives:\\eta(\\tau, t) + \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} \\Delta t + \\dots = \\eta(\\tau, t) - \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial \\tau} \\Delta t + \\dots.\n\nSimplifying and taking the limit as \\Delta t \\to 0 yields the governing equation:\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial \\tau}.\n\nThe RHS can be viewed as an age-related flux term.

Define P(n=N;t) as the probability that the population has a value of N individuals at time t:P(n=N;t).\n\nAdditionally, let \\mu denote the probability per unit time that an individual dies independently of others.

One method is to take the time derivative of the expected population size, represented by:E_n = \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} N P(n=N;t).\n\nBy multiplying both sides of Eq. \n\n(15) by N and taking the sum from 0 to infinity, we obtain:\\frac{d}{dt}\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} N P(n=N;t) = \\mu \\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} N(N+1)P(n=N+1;t) - \\mu\\sum_{N=0}^{\\infty} N^2 P(n=N;t).\n\nThrough some algebraic steps, this equation can be shown to reduce to:\\frac{d E_n}{dt} = - \\mu E_n\n\nNotice that Eq. \n\n(18) is identical to the deterministic Eq. \n\n(8). This implies the deterministic solution corresponds to the average behavior of repeated stochastic experiments, rather than describing any single experiment. It predicts exponential decay when considering expected population sizes over numerous trials.\n\nAnother approach is to find an exact solution to Eq. \n\n(15). It can be verified through substitution that:P(n=N;t) = \\frac{E_n^N(t)e^{-E_n(t)}}{N!},\n\nwhere E_n(t), satisfies Eq. \n\n(18). This has the form of a Poisson distribution, with mean E_n and standard deviation \\sqrt{E_n}.\n\nFor large values of E_n, the standard deviation becomes negligible compared to the mean. Therefore, even though the deterministic model in Eq. \n\n(8) does not describe individual stochastic trajectories, its predictions are expected to closely match the behavior of single realizations when population sizes are sufficiently large.\n\nWhile stochastic fluctuations are prominent for small populations, the deterministic exponential decay approximation becomes increasingly accurate as the number of individuals grows.

Understanding these fundamental characteristics provides critical insight into how even modest growth rates may translate to astonishingly rapid increases over long timescales. In this chapter, our aim is to develop a richer appreciation for both the power and limitations of exponential growth dynamics.","type":"content","url":"/ch05","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

It is important to consider that, in the absence of migration, new individuals arise in the population solely through the reproduction of existing individuals, as spontaneous generation is not possible. Therefore, we can modify Eq. \n\n(6) to accommodate births as follows:\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial \\tau} + \\beta(\\tau) \\eta - \\mu(\\tau) \\eta.\n\nIn this equation, the term \\partial \\eta / \\partial t represents the rate of change of the population density \\eta with respect to time t. The first term on the right-hand side, -\\partial \\eta / \\partial \\tau, accounts for the effect of aging on the population. The second term, \\beta(\\tau) \\eta, introduces the influence of births, where \\beta(\\tau) represents the birth rate as a function of age (\\tau). Finally, the third term, -\\mu(\\tau) \\eta, considers the mortality rate \\mu(\\tau), which represents the rate at which individuals of age \\tau die.\n\nBased on the findings presented in the previous chapter, and assuming that the probability density \\rho(\\tau, t) = \\nu(\\tau, t) / N(t) remains stationary, we can integrate Eq. \n\n(1) to obtain the following expression:\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\widetilde{\\beta} N - \\widetilde{\\mu} N,\n\nwhere \\widetilde{\\beta} and \\widetilde{\\mu} represent the average birth and death rates, respectively. These parameters are defined as \\widetilde{\\beta} = \\int_0^\\infty \\beta(\\tau') \\rho(\\tau') d\\tau' and \\widetilde{\\mu} = \\int_0^\\infty \\mu(\\tau') \\rho(\\tau') d\\tau'. The population size is represented by N(t) = \\int_0^\\infty \\eta(\\tau') d\\tau'. It is worth noting that, if both \\beta and \\mu are age-independent, we obtain the same result without requiring the stationarity of \\eta.\n\nBy introducing an effective growth rate \\alpha = \\widetilde{\\beta} - \\widetilde{\\mu}, we can reformulate Eq. \n\n(2) as follows:\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N.\n\nThis differential equation has a solution given by:N(t) = N_0 e^{\\alpha t},\n\nwhere N_0 represents the initial population size. If the death rate surpasses the birth rate, as studied in the previous chapter, the population would decay exponentially. However, if the opposite scenario occurs, where the birth rate surpasses the death rate, the population would experience exponential growth.","type":"content","url":"/ch05#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"5.

In a forthcoming chapter, we will introduce a more realistic population model called the logistic model. The logistic equation incorporates density-dependent effects like resource competition and saturation, allowing populations to stabilize at an environmental carrying capacity.

Steady states, or fixed points, are defined as constant solutions to a differential equation that do not change over time. Their stability determines whether nearby solutions will converge or diverge from the steady state. While graphical analysis can assess stability in 1D, a more rigorous analytical approach is required for higher dimensions. The method developed is to linearize the nonlinear dynamics near a steady state, resulting in a linear approximation governing small perturbations from the fixed point. The stability criterion is then derived from the solution to this linearized system---a steady state will be stable only if perturbations decay over time, indicated by the slope of the original function being negative at that point. This technique allows classification of steady state stability across any system dimensionality using analytical mathematics.","type":"content","url":"/ch06","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.

However, more realistic representations often involve nonlinear differential equations. Attaining a rigorous global understanding of these models necessitates a formal stability analysis of their steady states. A steady state corresponds to a constant solution. For a population, this represents an equilibrium point at which birth and death rates precisely balance. Studying the stability of steady states allows for the classification of long-term dynamical behavior and the discernment of global dynamics arising from local perturbations.\n\nJust as a balance at rest indicates equilibrium but imparts no insight into subsequent motion upon disturbance, steady states alone do not reveal dynamical fate. Their stability determines their attracting or repelling character, with implications for qualitative trajectories that may resemble balls inducted into concavities or convexities. Linearizing functions near steady states permits estimation of the evolution of small deviations, providing local qualitative forecasts. When stability analysis and linearization are combined, they provide qualitative understanding that exceeds model solutions, just as one may predict a ball’s motion from terrain alone despite transients obscuring endpoints. This chapter will introduce the tools to perform local stability analysis of 1-dimensional dynamical models.","type":"content","url":"/ch06#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.

Local Stability Analysis","lvl2":"Assessment of Fixed Point Stability via Graphical Analysis"},"content":"Consider the function f(x) depicted in Fig. \n\nFigure 1. Two roots, denoted x_1 and x_2, of the equation f(x)=0 are evident. Consequently, these locations define the steady states of the differential equation dx/dt=f(x).\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Graphical depiction of the function f(x) with two roots. This figure illustrates the function f(x) which possesses two roots, denoted by x_1 and x_2. The slope of f(x) is positive in the vicinity of x_1, as depicted by the upward sloping tangent. In contrast, the slope is negative near x_2, as shown by the downward sloping tangent. These slope characteristics determine the qualitative behavior of solutions initialized proximate to the steady states. Specifically, red arrows indicate that perturbations tend to diverge from x_1 while converging towards x_2. Therefore, x_1 represents an unstable fixed point whereas x_2 denotes a stable steady state. This graphical analysis conveys how the slope’s sign at steady state locations qualifies their attracting or repelling nature.\n\nLet us now analyze the stability of the fixed points. Consider x_1 and note the positive slope of f(x) at this location. A positive slope implies that for any initial condition marginally greater than x_1, the value of f(x) will be positive. Accordingly, this yields a positive rate of change for the value of x. Thus, the solution will move in a progressively greater direction, distancing itself from x_1. Similarly, for any initial value slightly less than x_1, the slope is such that the rate of change of x is negative. Consequently, the solution will decrease over time, drifting ever farther from x_1. From this analysis, we can see that x_1 is unstable as it repels nearby solutions over time.\n\nIn contrast, let us examine the stability of the other fixed point, x_2. At this location, the slope of f(x) is negative. Therefore, for any initial condition marginally greater than x_2, the value of f(x) will be negative. This implies the rate of change of x will also be negative, causing the solution to decrease in value over time and move closer to x_2. Similarly, for initial values slightly less than x_2, the negative slope indicates the rate of change of x is positive. Hence, the solution will increment in value, again tending towards x_2. We can thus deduce that perturbations from x_2 will be attracted back to this fixed point location over time. Consequently, x_2 is stable as it attracts solutions.\n\nIn summary, this graphical analysis demonstrates that the stability of a fixed point for the differential equation dx/dt=f(x) is determined solely by the sign of the slope of the function f(x) evaluated at that fixed point. A positive slope implies perturbations will move further away from the fixed point over time, characterizing it as unstable. In contrast, a negative slope signifies that perturbations will be attracted back to the fixed point location, marking it as stable.","type":"content","url":"/ch06#assessment-of-fixed-point-stability-via-graphical-analysis","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.

The graphic analysis relies on visualizing the slope of a scalar-valued function, which is only possible for one-dimensional models. However, real-world phenomena often evolve according to multidimensional dynamical systems that cannot be embedded in two-dimensional space for intuitive slope evaluation. Therefore, a more systematic technique is required that permits stability classification of fixed points for differential equations inhabiting abstract dimensionalities. In this section, we develop the method of local stability analysis through linearization. By approximating nonlinear dynamics near steady states via linear functions, this approach furnishes a quantitative framework to assess stability in any dimensional system. These analytical tools supersede qualitative geometric intuitions, instead providing mathematics directly applicable to complexity beyond what may be visualized.\n\nConsider once more the differential equation:\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x).\n\nWe want to analyze the stability of a steady state value x^*. To do this, we look at an arbitrary solution x(t) that starts out close to x^*. For the steady state to be locally stable, we need to show that x(t) converges to x^* as time goes to infinity:\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = x^*\n\nIt’s helpful to define the “distance function” \\delta x(t):\\delta x(t) = x(t) - x^*.\n\nThis tells us how far x(t) is from the steady state x^* at any time t. For our analysis to work, \\delta x(t) needs to converge to zero as time passes. Hence, we can write the stability condition in terms of \\delta x(t) as:\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\delta x(t) = 0.\n\nIn other words, for x^* to be stable, any small perturbations need to disappear over long times.\n\nWe seek to derive the governing differential equation for the dynamics of \\delta x(t). It can be readily shown from its definition in Eq. \n\n(5) that:\\frac{d\\delta x(t)}{dt} = \\frac{dx(t)}{dt}.\n\nSubstituting this expression and Eq. \n\n(5) into the original system dynamics in Eq. \n\n(3) yields:\\frac{d\\delta x}{dt} = f(x^* + \\delta x).\n\nLeveraging the assumption that \\delta x is small relative to x^*, we can approximate f(x^* + \\delta x) via a Taylor series expansion truncated after the first order term:f(x^* + \\delta x) \\approx f(x^*) + f'(x^*)\\delta x,\n\nwhere f'(x^*)=d f/d x|_{x=x^*}. Furthermore, since x^* defines a steady state, f(x^*)=0. Thus, the differential equation for \\delta x reduces to the following linear form:\\frac{d\\delta x}{dt} = f'(x^*)\\delta x.\n\nThe solution to this equation takes the form\\delta x(t) = \\delta x_0 e^{f'(x^*) t},\n\nwhere \\delta x_0 denotes the initial perturbation from the steady state x^*. It is evident from this last equation that a necessary condition for \\delta x(t) to asymptotically approach zero as t\\to\\infty is that f'(x^*)<0. In other words, the steady state x^* will only exhibit stable behavior if the slope of the function f(x) is negative when evaluated at x=x^*. In summary, local stability is assured only if perturbations decay over time, which occurs solely when the linearized dynamics represented by f'(x^*) are negative.","type":"content","url":"/ch06#local-stability-analysis","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"6.

Most notably, the model predicts unconstrained population expansion leading to infinite size, which is not feasible in reality. All natural populations are bound by finite resources in their environment. The exponential model also ignores factors like resource competition and carrying capacity effects that act to slow growth as the population approaches the limits of its habitat. As a result, the model cannot realistically depict long-term population behavior or stability. For populations existing in a closed ecological system with density-dependent influences, another type of population model is needed that incorporates limitations on growth from resource limitations and crowding effects. This will allow an investigation of population regulation and equilibrium conditions. The development of such a model, which involves including density-dependent feedback in the growth term, is necessary to more accurately represent population dynamics over long periods aligned with biological timescales.","type":"content","url":"/ch08#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"8.

Logistic Model","lvl2":"A Brief Historical Review"},"content":"Thomas Malthus was one of the earliest scholars to study population dynamics. In his 1798 treatise An Essay on the Principle of Population, Malthus hypothesized that human populations have an inherent capacity to grow exponentially if unchecked by outside forces. This is because populations can increase geometrically through reproduction. In contrast, he argued that the food resources required to support growing populations only increase in an arithmetic progression over time. As populations grow exponentially yet resources increase linearly, Malthus recognized that individuals would inevitably come into competition for limiting resources like food, space, and other necessities of life. This competition, he proposed, serves to slow population growth from its unchecked exponential rate down to a level sustainable given the available resources. Malthus’ ideas introduced the concept that populations are regulated by external factors related to resource availability and by the scarcity and struggle for existence that arises due to overpopulation. His insights formed the basis for later formal mathematical models of population dynamics.\n\nWhile Malthus recognized that populations cannot grow exponentially indefinitely, he did not provide a mathematical model to describe how growth becomes limited over time. It was the Belgian mathematician Pierre Verhulst who first developed an explicit equation incorporating this regulation mechanism. In 1838, Verhulst modified the simple exponential growth model based on Malthus’ arguments about competition for resources. He proposed adding a negative feedback term that increases in proportion to the population size, representing the growing scarcity and resultant effect on per capita growth rate as the population approaches the environment’s carrying capacity.","type":"content","url":"/ch08#a-brief-historical-review","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"8. Logistic Model","lvl2":"The Logistic Model"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ch08#the-logistic-model","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"8. Logistic Model","lvl2":"The Logistic Model"},"content":"We begin by recalling the differential equation that governs exponential population growth:\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\alpha N,\n\nwhere \\alpha is a constant growth rate parameter. Verhulst proposed modifying this model by substituting parameter \\alpha with a decreasing function of the population size N, denoted \\alpha(N). Specifically, he proposed a linear decay function of the form:\\alpha(N) = r\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right),\n\nwhere r represents the intrinsic per capita growth rate in the absence of density-dependent effects. Meanwhile, K denotes the environment’s biological carrying capacity; the maximum sustainable population size given resource constraints. This negative feedback term grows proportionally as N approaches K, introducing density-dependent regulation into the exponential growth formulation. Verhulst’s ingenious substitution of a variable growth rate function was a landmark development that produced the first quantitative model embodying Malthus’ concept of self-limitation through resource competition.\n\nThrough this modification, Verhulst produced the following nonlinear ordinary differential equation to govern population dynamics:\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right).\n\nVerhulst named the solution to this differential equation the “logistic function”. By extension, the overall model is commonly referred to as the “logistic model” of population growth. However, it is also appropriately termed the “Verhulst model”\n\nWe can solve the logistic differential equation—Eq. \n\n(3)—using variable transformations. First, introduce the change of variable x = 1/N. This transforms Eq. \n\n(3) to:\\frac{dx}{dt} = rx\\left(\\frac{1}{K} - x\\right).\n\nNext, define the variable y = x - 1/K, yielding:\\frac{dy}{dt} = -ry.\n\nThis has the solution y(t) = y_0e^{-rt}, where y_0 is the initial value. Transforming back through the steps, we arrive at the solution for the original variable N:N(t) = \\left[\\frac{1}{K} + \\left(\\frac{1}{N_0} - \\frac{1}{K}\\right)e^{-rt}\\right]^{-1}.\n\nThrough judicious variable substitutions, we have derived an explicit closed-form solution to the logistic differential equation governing population dynamics.\n\nEq. \n\n(6) is the well known logistic function. Consider the characteristics of this solution. The first term inside the brackets, 1/K, represents the asymptotic carrying capacity. As time increases, the exponential term e^{-rt} monotonically decays to zero. Therefore, in the limit of large time, the population N will approach the value:\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} N = K.\n\nThis shows that regardless of the initial population N_0, the solution will always converge to the environmental carrying capacity K. Physically, this makes sense; as time progresses, density-dependent effects will gradually dampen the growth rate until it balances perfectly with mortality to establish an equilibrium at the maximum sustainable size. The timescale to reach this steady state depends on the intrinsic growth rate r, but the ultimate attractor is always K. Therefore, the logistic model comprehensively captures the self-regulation of populations towards their local resource limits envisioned by Malthus.","type":"content","url":"/ch08#the-logistic-model","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"8. Logistic Model","lvl2":"Local Stability of Steady States"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/ch08#local-stability-of-steady-states","position":8},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"8. Logistic Model","lvl2":"Local Stability of Steady States"},"content":"While we derived an analytical solution for the logistic equation in the previous section, such closed-form expressions are rare for more complex nonlinear systems. However, even when an exact solution is unattainable, we can extract profound qualitative insights by examining the system’s steady states and their local stability. While analytical solutions provide a specific map of trajectories over time, stability analysis offers a rigorous framework for predicting long-term behavior. In this section, we adopt this perspective—identifying the logistic model’s fixed points and applying linearization to determine whether the system naturally recovers from, or diverges after, small perturbations.\n\nTo perform a local stability analysis, we first express the logistic differential equation—Eq. \n\n(3)—in the general autonomous form:\\frac{dN}{dt} = f(N),\n\nwhere the growth rate function is defined as:f(N) = rN \\left(1 - \\frac{N}{K}\\right)\n\nThe steady states (or fixed points) of the system occur where the rate of change is zero (f(N) = 0). Setting the growth function to zero and solving for N yields two distinct fixed points:\n\nN_1^* = 0: The trivial equilibrium (extinction).\n\nN_2^* = K: The non-trivial equilibrium (carrying capacity).\n\nThe stability of these points is determined by the linearization of the system. We calculate the derivative of f(N) to determine the slope of the growth function at each equilibrium:f'(N) = \\frac{d}{dN} \\left( rN - \\frac{rN^2}{K} \\right) = r - \\frac{2rN}{K}.\n\nBy evaluating this derivative at each fixed point, we can classify their stability based on the sign of the result (assuming r > 0).\n\nAt N_1^* = 0:f'(0) = r\n\nBecause f'(0) > 0, the slope is positive. This indicates that small perturbations will grow exponentially away from zero, making N_1^* an unstable fixed point.\n\nAt N_2^* = K:f'(K) = r - 2r = -r\n\nBecause f'(K) < 0, the slope is negative. This indicates that small perturbations will decay over time as the population returns to equilibrium, making N_2^* a locally stable fixed point.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Graphical analysis of fixed points and stability in the logistic growth model. This figure shows the growth rate function f(N)=rN(1-N/K). The two roots of this function, where it intersects the horizontal axis, are the fixed points (steady state solutions): N_1^*=0 and N_2^*=K. Local stability is determined by the slope of f(N) at each fixed point. At N_1^*=0, the slope is positive indicating nearby trajectories will diverge over time. Therefore, N_1^* denotes an unstable fixed point, represented by an open circle. In contrast, the slope of f(N) is negative at the carrying capacity N_2^*=K. Thus, small perturbations will contract back towards the fixed point. This characterizes N_2^* as a stable steady state solution, shown as a filled circle.\n\nThe analytical results can be interpreted geometrically by examining the graph of the growth rate function, f(N) = rN(1 - N/K). As shown in Fig. \n\nFigure 1, the fixed points N_1^* = 0 and N_2^* = K are the roots where the parabola intersects the horizontal axis.\n\nIn this graphical framework, local stability is determined by the sign of the function on either side of a fixed point. At N_1^* = 0, the function is positive for small N, indicating that the population will increase and move away from the origin; thus, N_1^* is an unstable node (represented by an open circle). Conversely, at the carrying capacity N_2^* = K, the function is positive for N < K and negative for N > K. This ensures that trajectories from both directions converge toward K, characterizing it as a locally stable steady state (represented by a filled circle).\n\nBeyond stability, this graphical analysis reveals the qualitative “shape” of the population’s path. Because f(N) is a concave-down parabola with a peak at N = K/2, we can predict two distinct growth behaviors:\n\nSigmoidal Growth (N_0 < K/2): If a population starts below half the carrying capacity, it enters a region where the growth rate is increasing (f'(N) > 0). It accelerates until it hits the midpoint K/2, after which the rate begins to decrease (f'(N) < 0), resulting in the characteristic S-shaped sigmoid curve.\n\nDecelerating Convergence (N_0 > K/2): For populations starting above the midpoint, the growth rate is already in decline. These populations decelerate immediately as they approach K. If N_0 > K, the growth rate is negative, and the population declines monotonically toward the carrying capacity.\n\nBy examining the slope and curvature of f(N), we can thus predict the inflection points and long-term fates of the system without ever solving the differential equation.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Qualitative trajectories of the logistic solution for varying initial conditions. This figure graphically depicts the logistic function given by Eq. {eq}`eq:08.02\n\nThe qualitative insights derived from the growth rate function, f(N), are directly reflected in the time-dependent behavior of the system. By plotting the analytical solution—Eq. {eq}eq:08.02—over time for various initial conditions N_0, we can visualize the emergent dynamics of the model (Fig. {ref}fig:08.02). For populations initialized below half the carrying capacity (N_0 < K/2), the trajectories exhibit an inflection point at N = K/2, resulting in the classic sigmoidal (S-shaped) growth curve. Conversely, for initial conditions above this threshold (N_0 > K/2), the growth rate is strictly decreasing, leading to monotonic convergence toward the carrying capacity K.\n\n​The alignment between the analytical solutions in Fig. {ref}fig:08.02 and the stability analysis in Fig. {ref}fig:08.01 confirms a fundamental principle of dynamical systems: local behavior near fixed points often dictates the global qualitative fate of the system. This cross-validation demonstrates that linearization and graphical analysis are not merely approximations; they are powerful diagnostic tools that provide a comprehensive understanding of population regulation.","type":"content","url":"/ch08#local-stability-of-steady-states","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"8.

This chapter extends the logistic framework to incorporate two critical biological realities: increased density-independent mortality and the Allee effect. Through these extensions, we move beyond simple convergence to carrying capacity and introduce the fundamental concepts of bifurcation theory and bistability. We demonstrate how rising mortality can trigger a transcritical bifurcation, where a population’s persistence is suddenly exchanged for certain extinction. Furthermore, we show how the Allee effect creates a survival threshold, leading to a system with two stable attractors. By analyzing these models, we gain a mechanistic understanding of “tipping points”—thresholds where minor changes in environmental conditions or population density can result in irreversible shifts in ecological viability.","type":"content","url":"/ch09","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"9.

Extending the logistic model","lvl2":"Increased mortality"},"content":"Up to this point, our logistic population model has assumed that the effective growth rate (the difference between the growth and death rates) is a linearly decreasing function of the population size. In some circumstances, environmental factors unrelated to population density, such as stressors or resource limitation, can elevate mortality. To incorporate this effect, we modify the logistic differential equation. Specifically, we add a term representing density-independent background mortality:\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN(1-N/K) - aN.\n\nHere, the parameter a \\geq 0 controls the strength of increased background mortality. When a=0, this model reduces to the basic logistic equation.\n\nTo perform a local stability analysis, we first rewrite the logistic differential equation, Eq. \n\n(1), in the general form:\\frac{dN}{dt} = f(N),\n\nwhere f(N)=rN(1-N/K)-aN. The steady state solutions, also known as fixed points, are given by values of N that satisfy f(N)=0. This yields two fixed points: the extinction state N^*_1=0, and the non-zero equilibrium N^*_2=K(r-a)/r.\n\nTo determine stability, we calculate the derivative of the function f(N) to obtain the slope at each fixed point. The derivative is:f'(N) = (r-a) - \\frac{2rN}{K}.\n\nEvaluating f' at the two fixed points gives: f'(N_1^*)=r-a and f'(N_2^*)=a-r. This reveals that when a<r, the extinction state N_1^* is unstable while the positive equilibrium N_2^* is stable. However, when the mortality rate exceeds the intrinsic growth rate (a>r), the stability of the fixed points switches; now the extinction state is stable, whereas the non-zero state N_2^* becomes unstable.\n\nGeometrically, we can gain insight into this transition by visualizing how the fixed points vary with the mortality rate parameter a, as illustrated in Fig. \n\nFigure 1. As a increases through the critical value of r, the two fixed points collide at a=r and trade stability. Topologically, this behavior corresponds to a transcritical bifurcation. Physically, it indicates that beyond a threshold level of background mortality, high death rates outweigh new births even at very low population sizes, thereby preventing the population from persisting over long-term. The bifurcation analysis thus provides a framework for understanding how environmental stresses influence population viability through changes in demographic rates.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Bifurcation diagram showing how the two steady state solutions, population extinction (N_1^*) and the positive equilibrium population size (N_2^*), vary dynamically with changes to the background mortality rate parameter (a). The extinction fixed point is depicted with orange lines, while the positive equilibrium is shown in blue. Stable steady states are depicted with solid lines, and unstable states with dashed lines. As a increases beyond the critical threshold value r, equivalent to the intrinsic growth rate, the fixed points intersect at the transcritical bifurcation point. This bifurcation signifies the exchange of stability between the two solutions, where population persistence loses stability and extinction gains stability with further increases in environmental mortality.\n\nThis model exhibits the first bifurcation encountered in this textbook. It is therefore worthwhile to discuss bifurcations in more detail. By definition, a bifurcation refers to a qualitative change in dynamical behavior that can emerge from small perturbations to parameter values. Specifically, at a bifurcation point the number and/or stability properties of fixed point solutions may abruptly shift. Some common types of bifurcations include:\n\nSaddle-node bifurcation: this occurs when two fixed points coalesce and annihilate one another.\n\nTranscritical bifurcation: a stable and unstable fixed point exchange stability at the critical parameter value.\n\nPitchfork bifurcation: a single fixed point loses stability, splitting into three solutions of which two are stable.\n\nBifurcations are significant because they delineate boundaries between distinct qualitative solution behaviors attainable within a model. Identifying these transition points provides insight into how sensitive model predictions are to perturbations of the governing equations.\n\nIn the modified logistic population model presented here, the bifurcation that occurs with rising background mortality is of the transcritical type. This bifurcation demarcates how increasing non-density dependent death rates can irreversibly drive the population to extinction once they surpass the capacity for growth. Specifically, as mortality rises past the critical threshold equal to the intrinsic per capita growth rate, the transcritical bifurcation causes the stable fixed point solution representing long-term population persistence to exchange stability with the unstable extinction point. Consequently, above this bifurcation value, mortality dominates reproduction even at very low densities throughout the entire parameter space. This example demonstrates that environmental stressors can precipitate a population tipping point between ongoing viability versus extinction by tilting the demographic balance through small alterations to basic rates of birth and death. Identifying such bifurcation-defined thresholds provides insight into how susceptible population persistence is to fluctuations in underlying biological parameters.","type":"content","url":"/ch09#increased-mortality","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"9.

This phenomenon, known as the Allee effect, arises due to difficulties finding mates and engaging in beneficial forms of cooperation at very low densities, resulting in decreased per capita growth. To represent this intrinsic difficulty in the logistic model, we introduce an Allee term as follows:\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right)\\left(\\frac{N}{A}-1\\right).\n\nIn this formulation, parameter 0 < A < K/2 represents a population threshold below which the effective per capita growth rate becomes negative, meaning that deaths exceed births.\n\nLet us analyze Eq. \n\n(4) in its general functional form, \\dot{N}=f(N), where f(N)=rN(1-N/K)(N/A-1). The form of this function f(N) is depicted graphically in Fig. \n\nFigure 2. As seen in the figure, f(N) intersects the horizontal axis at three distinct points, indicating the presence of three steady state solutions: population extinction at N_1^*=0, an interior equilibrium at N_2^*=A, and a second fixed point at the carrying capacity N_3^*=K. Furthermore, the derivatives satisfy f'(N_1^*)<0, f'(N_2^*)>0, and f'(N_3^*)<0. This confirms that N_1^* and N_3^* are stable nodes, while N_2^* is an unstable saddle point.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Graphical depiction of the function f(N)=rN(1-N/K)(N/A-1) describing per capita growth rate in the Allee effect model-Eq. {eq}`eq:09.02\n\nThe existence of two locally stable fixed points separated by an unstable steady state in this modified logistic model, namely the extinction state N_1^* and the positive carrying capacity N_3^*, gives rise to bistability in the system’s dynamics. Biologically, bistability implies that the population can persist indefinitely at either stable state of extinction or carrying capacity, with the final outcome dependent on initial conditions. Stochastic fluctuations may cause the population to randomly switch between attractors.\n\nThe logistic equation exhibiting an Allee effect is the first example in this textbook to demonstrate bistability. As a key feature of nonlinear systems, bistability will emerge again in other examples throughout this textbook, continually deepening our understanding of its consequences for real-world ecological and biological systems.","type":"content","url":"/ch09#allee-effect","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"9.

This approach reduces the stability criterion to checking the sign of the slope of the governing function at the steady state. However, many natural and engineered systems are described by models with two or more dimensions that cannot be intuitively visualized or analyzed using one-dimensional techniques. It is therefore necessary to generalize the technique of local stability analysis to higher-dimensional systems described by sets of coupled ordinary differential equations.\n\nIn this chapter, we extend the methodology of local stability analysis to two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems represented by a pair of coupled ordinary differential equations. While graphical analysis is no longer suitable, the algebraic framework of linearization remains valid. We will see that steady states are now defined as simultaneous solutions to two equations. Linearizing the system dynamics locally yields a 2\\times 2 Jacobian matrix governing small perturbations near the steady state. The matrix’s eigenstructure determines stability and allows a qualitative classification.\n\nBy deriving analytical stability criteria from the Jacobian eigenvalues, this approach provides insights into even relatively simple 2D models that are inaccessible through low-dimensional intuition alone. The methodology generalizes directly to higher dimensions through matrix analysis. Local stability analysis thus equips the study of multidimensional dynamical models with a systematic and mathematically rigorous technique.","type":"content","url":"/ch11#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"11.

Generally, the only solution to such a system is the trivial solution \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}. However, this trivial solution implies \\mathbf{\\delta r}(t) = \\mathbf{0}, meaning that the considered solution is already at the fixed point. This prevents analysis of the stability. A non-trivial solution exists only when the determinant of the coefficient matrix vanishes, i.e. when:\\det(\\mathbf{J} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0.\n\nExpanding this determinant condition gives:(f_x - \\lambda)(g_y - \\lambda) - f_y g_x = 0,\n\nWhich can be written compactly in terms of the trace \\tau=f_x+g_y and determinant \\Delta=f_x g_y - f_y g_x of the Jacobian matrix \\mathbf{J} as:\\lambda^2 - \\tau \\lambda + \\Delta = 0.\n\nEq. \n\n(14) takes the form of a characteristic quadratic polynomial, whose roots correspond to the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix \\mathbf{J}. The eigenvalues, \\lambda_{1,2}, can be explicitly computed by solving the characteristic polynomial:\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\tau \\pm \\sqrt{\\tau^2 - 4\\Delta}}{2}.\n\nAn analysis of this equation reveals key properties of the eigenvalues based on the values of the trace and determinant. Specifically:\n\nIf the determinant \\Delta < 0 (region I in Fig. \n\nFigure 1), then one eigenvalue will be positive while the other is negative, regardless of the sign of the trace \\tau.\n\nIf \\Delta > 0 and the discriminant \\tau^2 > 4\\Delta (regions II and V in Fig. \n\nFigure 1), then both eigenvalues will be real and have the same sign as the trace \\tau.\n\nIf \\Delta > 0 but the discriminant \\tau^2 < 4\\Delta, then the eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair in which \\tau is the real part (regions III and IV in Fig. \n\nFigure 1). Notably, when the trace \\tau = 0, the solutions eigenvalues are purely imaginary numbers.\n\nThe above analysis has delineated how the values of coefficients \\Delta and \\tau determine the possible configurations of the eigenvalues. We now aim to connect these eigenvalue configurations to criteria for classifying the stability of the fixed point.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Regions in the trace-determinant plane delineating qualitative configurations of the Jacobian matrix eigenvalues. The trace \\tau and determinant \\Delta values determine whether the eigenvalues are real or complex and their relative signs. Region I corresponds to eigenvalues of opposite sign, yielding a saddle node. Regions II and V exhibit real eigenvalues of the same sign, giving rise to unstable and stable nodes, respectively. Regions III and IV contain a complex conjugate eigenvalue pair, resulting in spiral node behavior characterized by rotational motion around the fixed point with exponential decay or growth modulated by the real part of the eigenvalues.\n\nRecall that the general solution of the linearized system is given by Eq. \n\n(10). When the eigenvectors \\mathbf{v}_1 and \\mathbf{v}_2 are unitary and linearly independent, they form a basis of the \\delta x-\\delta y space, and the terms C_1e^{\\lambda_1t} and C_2e^{\\lambda_2t} can be interpreted as the coordinates of the perturbation \\mathbf{\\delta r}(t) at time t in this eigenbasis.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Illustration of phase portraits for representative eigenvalue configurations near a fixed point. Panels: (a) Saddle node (Region I of Fig. \n\nFigure 1) showing an attracting and a repelling eigendirection; (b) Unstable node (Region II) with trajectories diverging along principal directions; (c) Stable node (Region V) with trajectories converging to the fixed point; (d) Unstable spiral (Region III) displaying outward spiraling motion; (e) Stable spiral (Region IV) displaying inward spiraling motion.\n\nConsidering the full solution as \\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r^*} + \\mathbf{\\delta r}(t), we see that C_1e^{\\lambda_1t} and C_2e^{\\lambda_2t} determine how the linearized solution \\mathbf{r}(t) evolves in a reference frame defined by the Jacobian eigenvectors and anchored at the fixed point \\mathbf{r^*}.\n\nWhen the eigenvalues are real, the eigenbasis coordinates C_1e^{\\lambda_1t} and C_2e^{\\lambda_2t} will exponentially decay or grow over time depending on the sign of the respective eigenvalues. A positive eigenvalue leads to exponential growth of the corresponding coordinate, while a negative eigenvalue implies exponential decay. This characterization of the perturbation growth informs the trajectory sketches shown in Fig. \n\nFigure 2 for regions I, II and V of Fig. \n\nFigure 1.\n\nThe steady state in region I, where one eigenvalue is positive and one is negative, corresponds to a saddle node. Near a saddle node, trajectories will flow away in one eigen-direction and towards the fixed point in the other direction, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 2a. A steady state in region II, where both eigenvalues are positive, is referred to as an unstable node. In this case, small perturbations will always grow exponentially, leading trajectories to flow outward from the fixed point in all directions, as shown in Fig. \n\nFigure 2b. In region V, where both eigenvalues are negative, the steady state is said to be a stable node. Here, perturbations decay exponentially fast, causing trajectories to converge onto the fixed point from all surrounding points in phase space, as depicted in Fig. \n\nFigure 2c.\n\nWhen the eigenvalues are complex, the linearized system possesses oscillatory behavior near the fixed point. For regions III and IV in Fig. \n\nFigure 1, where the trace \\tau and determinant \\Delta satisfy \\tau^2 < 4\\Delta, the eigenvalues form a complex conjugate pair \\lambda_{1,2} = \\alpha \\pm i\\beta. Substituting this into the general solution of the linearized system in Eq. \n\n(10) yields:\\mathbf{\\delta r}(t) = C_1\\mathbf{v}_1e^{\\alpha t}\\cos(\\beta t) + C_2\\mathbf{v}_2e^{\\alpha t}\\sin(\\beta t)\n\nObserve that the perturbation undergoes rotational motion, with an exponential decay or growth modulated by the real part \\alpha of the complex eigenvalues. Since \\alpha = \\tau/2, where \\tau is the trace of the Jacobian matrix, the sign of \\tau dictates whether the oscillations decay or grow exponentially over time. Specifically, when \\tau>0 the real part is positive (\\alpha>0), corresponding to region III of Fig. \n\nFigure 1 where perturbations spiral outward from the fixed point with exponential grow. Conversely, for \\tau<0 the real part is negative (\\alpha<0), describing region IV where oscillations spiral inward to the fixed point in a decaying manner. These behaviors are illustrated in Fig. \n\nFigure 2d and e.","type":"content","url":"/ch11#steady-state-classification","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"11.

One of them is population ecology, which aims to understand the dynamics of biological populations and the factors that cause fluctuations in population size over time. This includes seeking to explain how intrinsic growth rates interact with environmental constraints like resource availability, competition, and predation. While these questions have intrigued biologists and natural philosophers for centuries, it was not until the late 19th century that population ecology truly emerged as a distinct discipline within ecology.\n\nThis chapter traces the historical origin and development of population ecology as a quantitative, mathematical field of study. It explores the influential early thinkers who established the conceptual foundations, from Darwin and Spencer’s formative works on competition and population regulation, to Forbes pioneering quantitative field studies. The chapter then focuses on the key figures around the early 20th century who significantly advanced population ecology through new theoretical and modeling approaches---Clements, Adams, Lotka, and Volterra. Their innovative works helped define population ecology not just as a field of qualitative explanations, but as a discipline incorporating quantitative modeling of factors driving demographic change in populations.\n\nBy examining these pioneering scientists and how their ideas intertwined and built upon one another, this chapter aims to outline the lineage of thought that ultimately established population ecology as a the investigative framework still used today. The objective is to recognize population ecology’s intellectual roots and appreciate how incremental progress occurs in science through the efforts of diverse thinkers synthesizing different perspectives over generations.

Historical Origin of Population Ecology","lvl2":"Early Foundations of Population Ecology"},"content":"The foundations of population ecology emerged in the mid-19th century, paralleling the rise of ecology more broadly. Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace made enormous contributions through their formulation of the theory of evolution by natural selection. In On the Origin of Species (1859), Darwin established competition between individuals for limited resources as a key mechanism driving evolutionary change. He recognized populations as growing exponentially until constrained by environmental carrying capacities.\n\nHerbert Spencer built on these ideas in Principles of Biology (1864) with one of the first conceptual frameworks of population regulation. He theorized that populations achieve stable size through a balance of “nurturent” forces like reproduction and “accidental” forces like mortality. This introduced the principles of opposing demographic factors achieving dynamic equilibrium. Spencer envisioned ecology as encompassing networks of interdependencies rather than just adaptation.\n\nAround the same time, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel coined the term “ecology” and defined it as the study of organism-environment interactions. He highlighted interdependence between organisms and their environments, foreshadowing systems-thinking in ecology. Haeckel developed one of the first energy flow frameworks, seeing communities as integrated systems maintained through negative feedback loops.\n\nStephen Alfred Forbes conducted extensive field work on Illinois lakes in the late 1800s. His meticulous surveys provided empirical evidence supporting early theories, demonstrating density fluctuations between predator and prey populations over time. Forbes was also the first to propose that populations self-regulate through birth and death responses to environmental variables like resource availability. His work helped establish population ecology as an empirical, quantitative science.","type":"content","url":"/ch12#early-foundations-of-population-ecology","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"12.

He developed the analogy that plant communities mature through predictable stages of development akin to an organism. Clements stressed the community as a holistic superorganism shaped over time by interspecific cooperation as well as competition for resources.\n\nWhile criticized for underestimating stochastic events, Clements’ organismic perspective shaped early theoretical ecology. He recognized that populations do not fluctuate independently but are interconnected, with species influencing community trajectories through direct and indirect effects on one another. Clements also highlighted the importance of long-term ecological processes like facilitation and inhibition in driving dynamic changes to communities.\n\nJoseph Adams’ background in physical chemistry strongly influenced his development of quantitative population models. Concepts from statistical mechanics and chemical kinetics inspired Adams to mathematically relate observed macro-level population patterns to underlying micro-level reproductive and mortality processes.\n\nModels from physical chemistry describing how reaction rates change over time also motivated Adams to capture variation in demographic rates based on density dependence and environmental conditions. Additionally, viewing chemical systems as dynamic and open, rather than closed and static, aligned with Adams’ thinking of populations as regulated through inputs and outputs over generations.\n\nAdams was also influenced by emerging ideas in the field of geology during his career. Geologists were developing theories of dynamic equilibrium in integrated Earth systems achieved through compensatory positive and negative feedbacks acting over long timescales. These likely informed Adams’ consideration of population regulation around equilibrium levels.\n\nThrough such interdisciplinary lenses, Adams published highly influential works in the 1920s and 30s that established conceptual and methodological foundations for modern demographic analyses. His formulation of exponential and logistic population growth models represented pioneering efforts to quantitatively model intra-specific regulating factors theoretically posited by past scholars.\n\nAdams’ approach helped shift population ecology towards a more predictive science based on mathematical descriptions of population behavior over time.

Lotka’s 1925 work demonstrated how physical chemistry principles could be applied to biological systems. Inspired by concepts of energy flows and dissipation from his chemistry background, Lotka framed evolution as optimizing energy pathways through ecological networks.\n\nThis interdisciplinary energy perspective proved highly influential and represents an early application of systems thinking to theoretical ecology.

Past chapters have addressed intraspecific competition mathematically through the logistic model of population growth regulation.\n\nThis chapter focuses on interspecific competition, which occurs when multiple species utilize the same limited resources in a single area. As populations of coexisting species continuously interact through competition for necessities like food and shelter, their relative abundances shift in complex ways over time. Describing these population dynamics mathematically provides insights into how competition shapes community structure and long-term species coexistence.\n\nWe explore the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, one of the earliest and most influential models developed to study interspecific competition.

Over a century later, the Lotka-Volterra model remains fundamental to understanding phenomena like competitive exclusion and the conditions permitting diverse communities to coexist simultaneously.","type":"content","url":"/ch13#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"13.

Their competitive Lotka-Volterra model describes the population dynamics of two species, which we will refer to as species 1 and 2, competing for a shared limiting resource.\n\nThe model assumptions are:\n\nEach species exhibits logistic population growth in the absence of the other.\n\nCompetition arises through each species reducing the per capita growth rate of the other.\n\nBased on these, the governing equations are:\\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1N_1\\left(1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1} - a_{12}\\frac{N_2}{K_2}\\right) ,\\frac{dN_2}{dt} = r_2N_2\\left(1 - \\frac{N_2}{K_2} - a_{21}\\frac{N_1}{K_1}\\right),\n\nwhere:\n\nN_1 and N_2 are the population sizes of species 1 and 2.\n\nr_1 and r_2 are the intrinsic growth rates.\n\nK_1 and K_2 are the carrying capacities.\n\na_{12} and a_{21} are the interspecific competition coefficients.\n\nThis pair of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations represent the simplest mathematical model capturing the dynamics of competing populations based on limiting resources.

Competitive Lotka-Volterra Model","lvl2":"Analysis of the Non-Dimensional Model"},"content":"We now analyze the dynamics and behavior of the non-dimensional competitive Lotka-Volterra model derived in the previous section. We first examine the equilibrium points of the system, found by setting \n\n(1) and \n\n(2) equal to zero and solving the resulting system of algebraic equations. This gives four possible equilibrium points:E_1 = (0,0),  E_2 = (1,0),E_3 = (0,1),  E_4 = \\left(\\frac{1-a_{12}}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}, \\frac{1-a_{21}}{1+a_{12}a_{21}}\\right)\n\nThe equilibrium points E_1, E_2, and E_3 correspond to boundary equilibria representing the extinction of one or both species. Specifically, E_1 is the point of double extinction, E_2 is the extinction of species 2, and E_3 is the extinction of species 1.\n\nThe point E_4 is an interior equilibrium where both species can potentially coexist. Notably, E_4 exists in the positive quadrant where population sizes are greater than zero only when the interspecific competition coefficients satisfy either a_{12}, a_{21} < 1 or a_{12}, a_{21} > 1.\n\nTo analyze the stability of the equilibrium points, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the system defined by Eqs. \n\n(6)-\n\n(7). Taking the partial derivatives, the Jacobian is:J =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1-2n_1-a_{12}n_2 & -a_{12} n_1 \\\\\n-\\rho a_{21}n_2 & \\rho(1-2n_2-a_{21} n_1)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nEvaluated at each equilibrium point E_i, the Jacobian matrix J(E_i) characterizes the linearized behavior near that point. The stability type is determined by the eigenvalues of each J(E_i) matrix.\n\nEvaluating the Jacobian at the equilibrium point E_1=(0,0) gives:J(E_1) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\rho\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nAs this is a diagonal matrix, its eigenvectors are aligned with the n_1 and n_2 axes. The corresponding eigenvalues are 1 and \\rho. Since both eigenvalues are positive, the Jacobian evaluation indicates that E_1 is an unstable node, where small perturbations will drive the populations away from the double extinction equilibrium.\n\nThe Jacobian evaluated at E_2 givesJ(E_2) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -a_{12} \\\\\n0 & \\rho(1-a_{21})\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\nOne of its eigenvectors is aligned with the n_1 axis and its corresponding eigenvalue is -1. The other eigenvector is\\left(\\frac{a_{12}}{\\rho(a_{21}-1)-1}, 1\\right),\n\nwhile its associated eigenvalue is \\rho(1-a_{21}). Therefore, when a_{21}>1 the eigenvalue is negative and the fixed point is a stable node. Contrarily, when a_{21}<1 the eigenvalue is positive and the fixed point is a stable node. Notably, the stability of the fixed point where species n_1 is the sole survivor is determined by its aggressiveness.\n\nThe Jacobian evaluated at E_2 givesJ(E_2) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -a_{12} \\\\\n0 & \\rho(1-a_{21})\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nOne of its eigenvectors is aligned with the n_1 axis and its corresponding eigenvalue is -1. The other eigenvector is\\left(\\frac{a_{12}}{\\rho(a_{21}-1)-1}, 1\\right),\n\nwhile its associated eigenvalue is \\rho(1-a_{21}). Therefore, when a_{21}>1, this eigenvalue is negative and the fixed point E_2 is a stable node, representing the stable extinction of species 2. Contrarily, when a_{21}<1 the eigenvalue is positive and E_2 is an unstable node, meaning small perturbations will drive the system away from the extinction of species 2. In summary, the stability of the fixed point where only species 1 survives depends on the competitiveness of species 2, represented by the parameter a_{21}.\n\nThe Jacobian evaluated at E_3 is:J(E_3) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\rho(1-a_{12}) & 0 \\\\\n-a_{21} & -1\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\nThe eigenvector aligned with the n_2 axis has an eigenvalue of -1. The other eigenvector is\\left(1, \\frac{a_{21}}{\\rho(a_{12}-1)-1} \\right),\n\nwith associated eigenvalue \\rho(1-a_{12}). Therefore, when a_{12}>1 this eigenvalue is negative and E_3 is a stable node, representing the stable extinction of species 1. However, when a_{12}<1 the eigenvalue is positive and E_3 is an unstable node, meaning small perturbations will drive the system away from the extinction of species 1. Analogous to E_2, the stability of the fixed point where only species 2 survives depends on the competitiveness of species 1, given by the parameter a_{12}.\n\nThe Jacobian at the interior coexistence equilibrium E_4 is:J(E_4) = \\frac{1}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n    a_{12}-1 & a_{12} (a_{12}-1) \\\\\n \\rho a_{21} (a_{21}-1) & \\rho(a_{21}-1)\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\nThe stability of E_4 depends on the eigenvalues of J(E_4), which are given by:\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{\\tau \\pm \\sqrt{\\tau^2 - 4\\Delta}}{2},\n\nwhere the trace \\tau and determinant \\Delta are:\\tau = \\frac{(a_{12}-1)+\\rho(a_{21}-1)}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}, \\quad\n    \\Delta = \\frac{\\rho(a_{12}-1)(a_{21}-1)}{1-a_{12}a_{21}}\n\nIt can be shown that:\\tau^2 - 4\\Delta = \\frac{[(a_{12}-1)+\\rho(a_{21}-1)]^2 + 4\\rho a_{12}a_{21}(a_{12}-1)(a_{21}-1)}{(1-a_{12}a_{21})^2}\n\nSince E_4 only exists in the positive quadrant when a_{12},a_{21}<1 or a_{12},a_{21}>1, this further implies that the eigenvalues are real. If \\Delta>0, the eigenvalues have the same sign as \\tau, while one is positive and one negative otherwise. Finally, E_4 is a saddle when a_{12},a_{21}>1 because \\Delta<1, but a stable node when a_{12},a_{21}<1 since \\Delta>0 and \\tau<0.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Qualitative behavior of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model in the four regimes defined by the competition coefficients a_{12} and a_{21}\n\nThe previous analysis reveals four possible long-term scenarios based on the competition coefficients a_{12} and a_{21}, as illustrated in Fig. \n\nFigure 1:\n\nWhen a_{12} > 1 and a_{21} < 1, the extinction equilibrium E_2 is the sole steady state. In this case, species 1 dominates competition and excludes species 2 in the long run for nearly all starting population levels.\n\nConversely, when a_{12} < 1 and a_{21} > 1, E_3 is the only equilibrium. Now species 2 is competitively superior and drives species 1 extinct in the long run.\n\nWhen a_{12} and a_{21} are both less than 1, E_4 represents the sole steady state. Here, interspecific competition is weak enough to allow the long-term coexistence of both species for most initial conditions.\n\nFinally, if a_{12} and a_{21} both exceed 1, the extinction equilibria E_2 and E_3 become stable, creating a bistable system. In this case, the phase plane separates into two basins of attraction defined by a separatrix running through E_1 and E_4. Populations beginning in either basin asymptotically approach either the E_2 or E_3 equilibrium exclusively.\n\nThe results of this model analysis have important implications for understanding competitive interactions and community assembly in ecological systems. When interspecific competition is strong, meaning one species is highly dominant over the other, the model predicts that stable coexistence is not possible long-term. The inferior competitor will be excluded from the community. This upholds Gause’s principle of competitive exclusion, which states that no two species can occupy the same niche indefinitely if competing for the same limiting resources.\n\nHowever, when interspecific competition is weak or mutualistic, the model indicates stable coexistence may occur. Only under conditions of weak resource overlap or facilitation between species can a diverse competitive community persist over generations. This provides insight into how biodiversity is maintained; strong niche differentiation or weak competitive effects allow multiple similar species to stably co-occupy an area together. Overall, the results tie competitive hierarchies directly to potential long-term diversity outcomes, deepening our comprehension of community structure and dynamics.","type":"content","url":"/ch13#analysis-of-the-non-dimensional-model","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"13.

By capturing the essential dynamics of competing populations through logistic growth and competitive reductions to per capita growth rates, the model provides a mathematical framework for exploring how competition shapes long-term community outcomes.\n\nDespite many unrealistic assumptions, such as constant competition coefficients and symmetrical interspecific effects, the Lotka-Volterra model successfully describes the four qualitative behaviors that can emerge from competitive interactions. These regimes, distinguished by the relative competitive abilities of each species, predict different long-term fates ranging from coexistence to exclusion. In this way, the model functions well as an abstract, conceptual explanatory model rather than a quantitatively predictive one.\n\nExplanatory models like Lotka-Volterra aim to provide mechanistic understanding of natural phenomena, rather than detailed forecasts of real populations. They distill the essence of a process into mathematical terms to investigate general principles and properties. While simplifying assumptions neglect ecological complexities, this allows revealing underlying dynamics that may otherwise remain obscure. The insights generated can then guide more realistic, data-driven modeling as our comprehension progresses.\n\nNaturally, limitations arise from unrealistic assumptions. Despite this, the Lotka-Volterra model fulfills its purpose of building foundational understanding rather than accurate prediction for any specific system.

One of the simplest yet most influential epidemiological models is the SIR model. Proposed in the early 20th century, the SIR model divides a population into three categories---Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered---and represents transmission through a system of differential equations.\n\nDespite its assumptions of homogeneous mixing and exponential recovery rates, the SIR model has provided fundamental insights into disease dynamics. Threshold quantities like the basic reproduction number R_0 characterize when an outbreak will occur based on transmission rates. Analytic solutions also demonstrate a range of epidemiological behaviors from disease invasion and persistence to endemic equilibrium.\n\nThe basic SIR framework has served as a starting point for extending models to consider additional biological and external influence realistically. Yet even in its simple form, the model illustrates how self-organizing transmission processes alone can lead to complex episodic outbreak patterns on the population scale. SIR analyses and simulations provide an elegant, versatile tool to study disease control strategies from targeted quarantines to vaccination programs.\n\nIn this chapter, we will introduce the SIR modeling framework in detail. We will formulate the compartmental differential equations, obtain analytic solutions, and explore simulation-based analyses. Examples will demonstrate how this basic setup can be applied to real disease systems while also motivating extensions. The goal is to establish the conceptual and technical foundations of SIR modeling as a foundation for more complex and realistic epidemiological representations.","type":"content","url":"/ch14#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"14.

The following assumptions are made:\n\nIndividuals mix homogeneously; the probability of contact between any two individuals is equal.\n\nUpon infection, individuals immediately become infectious.\n\nTransmission occurs through contact between susceptible and infected individuals. The rate of new infections is thus proportional to both the number of susceptible (S) and infected (I) individuals, with proportionality constant \\beta known as the transmission rate.\n\nInfected individuals recover at a constant rate \\gamma and acquire lifelong immunity.\n\nThe population birth rate is constant and denoted by \\alpha.\n\nIndividuals in all compartments die due to causes other than disease at constant rate \\mu, and infected individuals also die due to causes directly associated to the disease at a constant rate \\delta.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Schematic representation of the SIR model compartmental structure and transitions.

Infected individuals recover at rate \\gamma and enter the recovered compartment R with lasting immunity. All compartments face a baseline death rate \\mu. Additionally, infectious individuals face an extra disease-induced death rate \\delta owing to pathogenic effects.\n\nThese mechanisms are schematically represented in Fig. \n\nFigure 1 which pictures infection dynamics as flux-balance processes. Taking this into consideration, the population evolution in all compartments can then be expressed as a system of ordinary differential equations:\\frac{dS}{dt} = \\alpha -\\beta SI -\\mu S,\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta SI - (\\gamma + \\mu + \\delta) I,\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I - \\mu R.","type":"content","url":"/ch14#model-formulation","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"14.

First, it reduces the original model with 5 parameters to an equivalent model with only 3 non-dimensional lumped parameters. This simplifies the analysis. Second, some of these lumped parameters have special epidemiological meaning. In particular, R_0 is known as the basic reproductive number. To understand its significance, rewrite R_0 as:R_0 = \\beta \\frac{\\alpha}{\\mu} \\frac{1}{\\mu+\\gamma+\\delta}.\n\n\\beta represents the number of new infections generated by each infectious individual per unit time. \\alpha/\\mu is the disease-free population size. Thus, \\beta \\alpha / \\mu gives the number of infections generated per unit time by one infectious individual introduced into a completely susceptible population. Meanwhile, 1/(\\mu+\\gamma+\\delta) is the average time an individual spends in the infectious compartment before either recovering or dying. Multiplying these terms gives R_0, which can thus be interpreted as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual introduced into a wholly susceptible population.

This subsystem can be analyzed independently of r, then the solutions for i can be substituted into the third equation to solve for r.\n\nFocusing first on the independent (s,i) subsystem will allow us to characterize the overall infection dynamics without consideration of the recovered population. Solving this core transmission model will provide insight into whether the disease can invade and establish infection within the population.\n\nRewriting this subsystem\\frac{ds}{dt'} = 1 - R_0 si - s,\\frac{di}{dt'} = \\rho (R_0 si - i).\n\nIt is straightforward to prove that it has two different fixed points:(1,0), \\quad  \\left( \\frac{1}{R_0}, 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} \\right).\n\nTo analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, we compute the Jacobian matrix of the reduced subsystem:J =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 -R_0 i & -R_0 s \\\\\n\\rho R_0 i & \\rho(R_0 s - 1)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nEvaluating this at the disease-free fixed point (1,0) gives:J(1,0) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & -R_0 \\\\\n0 & \\rho(R_0 - 1)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nThe eigenvectors of the Jacobian matrix are:v_1 = (1, 0),v_2 = \\left(-\\frac{R_0}{1+\\rho(R_0 - 1)}, 1\\right),\n\nwith corresponding eigenvalues:\\lambda_1 = -1, \\quad \\lambda_2 = \\rho (R_0 - 1).\n\nThese results indicate that the disease-free fixed point is locally asymptotically stable when R_0<1, and unstable otherwise, transitioning to a saddle point structure at the critical value of R_0=1. This stability switches at the epidemic threshold of R_0=1.\n\nWe can investigate the stability of the endemic equilibrium by evaluating the Jacobian matrix at (1/R_0, 1-1/R_0):J(1/R_0, 1-1/R_0) =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-R_0 & -1 \\\\\n\\rho(R_0 -1) & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nRather than computing the eigenvalues directly, which could yield cumbersome expressions, we analyze the Jacobian trace (\\tau) and determinant (\\Delta):\\tau = -R_0,\\Delta = \\rho (R_0 -1).\n\nFrom these results, we see that \\Delta<0 when R_0<1, indicating the endemic equilibrium is a saddle node in this case. Additionally, for R_0>1, \\Delta>0 and \\tau<0, implying that the endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. In summary, the trace and determinant criteria reveal that the endemic fixed point undergoes a transcritical bifurcation, transitioning from a saddle to a stable node as R_0 passes through the threshold value of 1.\n\nFig. \n\nFigure 2 summarizes the findings of the local stability analysis. Observe that, in the endemic state, i^* takes negative values when R_0<1. This means that, in practice, only the disease-free steady state exists when the average number of secondary infections produced by a single infectious individual introduced into a wholly susceptible population is less than one.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Steady-state values and stability domains as a function of the basic reproduction number, R_0. (Left) In the disease-free state, the fraction of susceptible individuals, s^*, remains at 1, represented by the blue curve. However, in the endemic-disease state s^* decreases inversely with R_0, shown by the red curve. (Right) The normalized infected fraction at equilibrium, i^*, is zero in the disease-free state (blue curve) and increases as 1 - 1/R_0 in the endemic-disease state (red curve). A transcritical bifurcation occurs at R0=1. For R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is stable (solid lines) while the endemic steady state is unstable (dashed lines). At the bifurcation point, the two equilibria collide and their stability reverses for R0 > 1.\n\nIn summary, the SIR model predicts two possible long-term outcomes depending on the value of R_0. Specifically, the model has two steady states: a disease-free equilibrium where the infection is eliminated, and an endemic equilibrium where the disease persists at a constant level in the population.\n\nThe stability analysis revealed that a critical transition occurs at R_0=1. For R_0<1, the disease-free state is locally asymptotically stable, meaning any small perturbation will fade out as the infection dies from the population. However, when R_0>1, the disease-free equilibrium loses stability. This same threshold governs the stability of the endemic equilibrium, which undergoes a bifurcation at R_0=1. Below the threshold, the endemic state is a saddle node and unstable. But for R_0>1, it transitions to a stable node.\n\nBiologically, R_0 represents the average number of secondary cases produced by one infected individual in a fully susceptible population. Hence, by determining whether R_0 is above or below one, we can predict if a disease invasion is likely to succeed or fail at establishing long-term transmission within the community. The stability analysis therefore provides key insights into disease dynamics based on the epidemiological threshold defined by R_0.\n\nBased on the definition of R_0, there are a few measures that can be taken to reduce its value:\n\nReduce transmission rate (\\beta). Public health interventions that decrease the risk of transmission during contact, such as hand hygiene, masks, distancing, and ventilation, will lower \\beta. Non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns and restrictions on gatherings that reduce social contact frequency also impact \\beta.\n\nIncrease recovery rate (\\gamma). Providing supportive medical care and targeted treatment to infected individuals can help speed their recovery and shorten the duration that they remain infectious, effectively increasing parameter \\gamma.\n\nIncrease removal rate (\\delta). In agricultural or wildlife settings, humane culling of visibly infected individuals can effectively increase the disease-induced mortality rate parameter \\delta. However, in human populations a more ethical approach is to quickly identify infectious individuals through widespread testing and rigorous contact tracing and place them in isolation.\n\nReduce influx into susceptible class (\\alpha). Rather than interpretation as birth rate, \\alpha is better viewed as the rate at which new individuals become susceptible, such as through loss of immunity. Vaccination upon birth or entrance into the susceptible population lowers this parameter without unwanted demographic effects.\n\nCombination of approaches: The most effective strategies often combine multiple types of measures simultaneously. This creates additive reductions in R_0 through independent pathways compared to single measures.","type":"content","url":"/ch14#fixed-points-and-stability-analysis","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"14.

The model’s enduring value stems from its ability to isolate a minimal set of elements necessary to mathematically represent infectious propagation through a population based on transmission between individuals. Though heterogeneous mixing, temporary immunity, and other real-world complexities are ignored, the model framework provides conceptual and predictive insights that have remained highly relevant.\n\nDespite its limitations, the SIR model elucidated critical but unintuitive properties like the existence of epidemic thresholds defined by epidemic quantities like R0. Threshold effects and bifurcation behaviors revealed through model analysis explain why certain interventions can entirely curb outbreaks while others have negligible impact. Such lessons challenge naïve assessments and guide rational intervention design.\n\nPerhaps most remarkably, the simple SIR rules give rise to complex and varied overall infection patterns at the system scale depending on parameter conditions. Self-organized criticality and phase transition phenomena emerge from local inter-individual interactions alone. These phenomena shed light on how diseases can transition between disparate outbreak modes from fleeting invasion to endemic stability.\n\nThe model’s intrinsic value also lies in its explanatory character; by distilling phenomena to essential mathematical elements, relationships between underlying factors and observable behaviors are uncovered. This enhances conceptual understanding beyond empirical observations alone. The model serves as a framework upon which more realistic representations can be built through principled expansions, while preserving core transmission dynamics.\n\nIn summary, despite being formulated over a century ago with limited data and computational power, the SIR model has proven to transcend its restrictive assumptions through theoretical and practical insights that remain highly relevant today.

From the iconic miniaturization procedure aboard the submarine in Fantastic Voyage, to the hapless kids shrunk to ant proportions in Honey I Shrunk the Kids, popular cinema has long toyed with the possibilities of manipulating scale. However enthralling these cinematic tales may be, a closer examination of biological scaling principles reveals such size-changing scenarios violate the rigorous constraints shaping life at even its most fundamental levels.\n\nWhile celebrated pioneers like Galileo Galilei first began piecing together the mathematical rules governing structural scaling across the natural world, modern integrative biology has further illuminated why modification of size alone disrupts the interdependent design of organisms. Through detailed analysis of traits from bone dimensions to metabolic rates, scientists now understand structures, functions and processes have all evolved in coordinated balance to suit a species’ particular stature. Size is but one facet of an exquisitely calibrated architecture, a single thread in the woven tapestry of form and function.\n\nThis chapter examines how biological structures and processes scale in relation to size at different levels, from bones to metabolism to evolution. This helps explain why scenarios of artificially changing an organism’s size portrayed in movies are unrealistic given the intricate relationships required for life. It also demonstrates Biology’s ``scaled\" nature---the way phenomena exist across a vast range of magnitudes, from molecules to entire populations, and can only be understood by considering the appropriate scale.","type":"content","url":"/ch15#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"15.

A Matter of Scales","lvl2":"Structural scaling"},"content":"One of the earliest scientists to recognize patterns in animal body sizes was Galileo Galilei in the 1600s. Even without modern technology, he carefully observed bone structures across species of different masses. In his work Dialogues Concerning Two New Sciences, Galileo described finding consistent relationships when comparing the femurs (thighbones) of land animals.\n\nHe noticed that as an animal’s overall bulk increases, the diameter of weight-bearing long bones like the femur expands at a faster rate than the bone’s length. What did this mean? Simply put, bigger animals need sturdier bones to carry their heavier weight. While a femur’s length relates to body size, mass grows exponentially with increasing size. Additionally, bone strength comes mainly from its thickness, not length.\n\nUsing basic mechanics, Galileo reasoned that for an animal’s femur to withstand the extra stress of greater mass, its width must increase more quickly than overall growth. His discovery launched quantitative studies of how material properties and designs cope with size-dependent stresses.\n\nThis scaling relationship helps explain why miniaturizing or enlarging creatures as shown in movies is unrealistic if proportions stay the same. For example, shrinking a human while preserving relative femur dimensions would result in bones much thicker than needed, limiting movement. Stretching proportions to enlarge a mouse would create femurs too slender to hold its increased weight without breaking. Nature has perfectly evolved size-calibrated solutions through evolutionary scaling of structures and functions.","type":"content","url":"/ch15#structural-scaling","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"15.

Warm-blooded animals like mammals and birds maintain a relatively constant internal temperature higher than their surroundings, necessitating continual heat production to offset heat loss.\n\nAll objects lose heat through their external surface area. Hence, for any given temperature difference from the environment, smaller animals lose heat faster relative to their bulk than larger organisms. Mathematically, surface area scales with mass elevated to the two-thirds power, whereas the internal volume heating the body scales closer to mass. This means that heat flux away from small bodies is disproportionately large versus what their mass alone would suggest.\n\nAt the same time, bodies generate metabolic heat through the biochemical reactions of cells. Cellular number scales close to an organism’s mass, but volumetrically within its three-dimensional form. Putting these scaling rules together, scientists expect metabolic rate to rise with approximately the two thirds power of mass for warmth to be evenly distributed regardless of size.\n\nIntriguingly, empirical studies confirm most mammals and birds qualitatively adhere to power-law scaling of basal metabolism. This is exemplified by hummingbirds working furiously to offest fast cooling. Artificial size changes isolated from evolutionary context would similarly cause metabolic misalignments causing overheating or shutdown of smaller or larger fabricated bodies.

Natural selection shapes life through proportional, multi-generational modifications aligning form and function across scales in response to environmental forces. While size itself may change gradually over extended periods, the proportional tuning of all supporting parameters remains subject to strict biological scaling laws.\n\nWhen considering evolutionary requirements, it becomes clear that simply shrinking or stretching an organism would disrupt the exquisite interdependencies so carefully optimized through natural processes. Studying biological scaling elucidates life’s inherent multi-scalar character, as traits manifest and vary contingent on the level of analysis. Phenomena appear only when observing the relevant magnitude; molecules, cells, individuals, ecosystems and beyond all influence one another. Mathematically modeling such complexity also requires representing relationships flexibly across domains.\n\nUltimately, these principles demonstrate both the stringent design constraints on bioengineering novel sizes and what we gain by evaluating hypotheses through a scale-aware lens.

It is therefore important to understand the dynamics of disease spread and characterize factors determining outbreak size and duration. The classic SIR compartmental model provides a useful framework for modeling infection transmission at the population level. It incorporates demographic fluxes due to births and deaths. However, in many outbreak settings, the timescales over which infections and recoveries occur are much faster than demographic turnover.\n\nAs such, during the initial spread and peak of an outbreak, the influence of births and deaths can be neglected as a first approximation. In this chapter, we develop and analyze a simplified version of the SIR model that ignores demographic fluxes. This allows us to focus specifically on the short-term infection dynamics over the course of an outbreak. Understanding how the basic infection and recovery processes drive temporal changes in disease prevalence at this timescale is highly relevant from a public health perspective.\n\nKey determinants of outbreak size and duration need to be identified to effectively target intervention strategies. The simplified SIR model provides a tractable framework for characterizing the influence of transmission rate, recovery rate, and other epidemiological parameters on short-term infection dynamics. Analytical insights will be used to explore model predictions and make connections to real-world outbreak settings. Overall, this analysis aims to complement the full demographic SIR model by illuminating infection spread mechanisms operating over a distinct, epidemiologically important short-term timescale.","type":"content","url":"/ch16#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"16.

The population is divided into three mutually exclusive health states: susceptible (S); infected (I); and recovered (R).

The per capita rate of new infections is proportional to the product of the number of susceptible and infectious individuals, with proportionality constant \\beta known as the infection rate.\n\nInfected individuals recover at a constant per capita recovery rate \\gamma.\n\nIn the absence of demographic factors like birth, death, immigration or emigration, the total population size N=S+I+R remains fixed.\n\nThese assumptions allow formulation of the following system of ordinary differential equations:\\frac{dS}{dt}  = -\\beta SI,\\frac{dI}{dt}  = \\beta SI - \\gamma I,\\frac{dR}{dt}  = \\gamma I.\n\nThe total population size is non-dimensionalized to 1 by defining normalized variables s=S/N, i=I/N, r=R/N and a rescaled time t'=\\gamma t.

A steady state occurs when the time derivatives vanish such that ds/dt'=di/dt'=dr/dt'=0.

Hence, there exists a continuum of disease-free equilibria (DFE) given by:s^* = \\eta, \\quad i^* = 0, \\quad r^* = 1-\\eta,\n\nwhere \\eta can range between 0 and 1, representing all possible mixtures of the susceptible and recovered populations when the disease is absent.\n\nTo assess stability, we calculate the Jacobian matrix J and evaluate it at each DFE.

However, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the Silk Road was disrupted, making trade routes to Asia and the Middle East more cumbersome and expensive for Europeans. To circumvent this challenge, explorers set out to discover direct sea routes to Asia, leading to voyages such as Christopher Columbus’ discovery of the Americas in 1492, Vasco da Gama’s expedition that reached India by sailing around Africa in 1498, and the voyage of circumnavigation initially commanded by Ferdinand Magellan and completed in 1522 \n\nParry (1992). These journeys were soon followed by others from various European powers, marking the beginning of the Age of Exploration, which spanned from the 15th to the 18th century and produced significant changes in global trade, culture, and politics.\n\nThe contributions of Islamic scholars during the Islamic Golden Age, which spanned from the 8th to the 14th century, in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and geography are partly responsible for the accomplishments of the Age of Exploration \n\nHodgson (1977). They contributed significantly to the translation and preservation of works from the Greek and Roman eras, which had a major impact on philosophers of the European Renaissance. Since navigation relied heavily on the observation of celestial bodies prior to the 18th century, the contributions in astronomy and mathematics were particularly notable. However, astronomical methods only allowed sailors to determine their latitude, or their north-south position, while determining longitude was a more challenging task. This challenge came to be known as the longitude problem.\n\nAccurate determination of longitude was vital for ensuring safe navigation, particularly during lengthy voyages. Vessels capable of precisely calculating their position faced reduced risks of grounding, collision, or becoming lost at sea. This not only protected the lives of sailors but also safeguarded valuable cargo, minimizing losses for ship owners and merchants. Additionally, efficient navigation reduced travel time, enabling ships to undertake more voyages and enhance profitability. To promote advancements in this crucial area, the British government introduced the Longitude Prize, also referred to as the Longitude Act, in 1714. This competition aimed to encourage the creation of a dependable and feasible method for determining longitude at sea \n\nSobel (2007).\n\nJohn Harrison, a British clockmaker, successfully tackled the problem of determining longitude. Harrison recognized the importance of accurate timekeeping in solving this problem. Rather than relying on celestial observations, Harrison proposed that a meticulously crafted timepiece could allow sailors to keep track of the time at a reference location and compare it to the local time. By comparing the local and reference times, it was possible to convert the difference in hours, minutes, and seconds into a reliable indicator of longitude.\n\nJohn Harrison was born in 1693 in Yorkshire, England. From a young age, he displayed exceptional skill as a carpenter and clockmaker. In the 1720s, Harrison moved to London and began designing innovative clocks, including long-case clocks with novel mechanisms. Interested in the Longitude Prize, he set out to design a marine chronometer that could maintain accuracy under the harsh conditions encountered on transoceanic voyages.\n\nFollowing on the steps of scientists and clock-makers like Christiaan Huygens, Harrison crafted a series of marine chronometers. The first, known as H1, was finished in 1735. It pioneered innovations such as the use of ``grasshopper escapement\" and temperature compensation through a bimetallic strip. However, issues with operation at sea meant further refinements were needed.\n\nOver the next few decades, Harrison went on to develop the H2, H3 and finally the H4 models, incrementally improving the timekeeping accuracy and durability. The H4 chronometer, completed in 1759, was a compact, high-performance device that fully met the demands of marine navigation. In rigorous sea trials, it kept time to within a few seconds per day, allowing longitude to be calculated to within half a degree.\n\nThe Board of Longitude was reluctant to fully award Harrison the prize money, leading to a prolonged dispute. However, his chronometers were widely recognized as a monumental achievement. Their unprecedented accuracy revolutionized navigation and enabled the great voyages of exploration that expanded global knowledge.\n\nAt its core, Harrison’s ingenious solution to the longitude problem required developing a sustained mechanical oscillator that could remain perpetual and constant for months under the harsh conditions of ocean voyages. The marine chronometer’s clockwork mechanism is precisely an oscillator in which energy dissipated through friction is continually replenished. This allows the periodic motion to be maintained indefinitely, enabling accurate timekeeping over long periods.","type":"content","url":"/ch17#the-longitude-problem-and-the-development-of-clocks","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"17.

However, the nineteenth century ushered in a new paradigm as scientists sought to harness the power of electromagnetic waves. Just as the perpetual motion of Harrison’s clocks arose from carefully sustaining a harmonic system, steady electrical oscillations would prove vital for powering modern wireless communication.\n\nThe pioneering experiments on electricity and magnetism conducted in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries laid the foundation for understanding oscillatory electrical phenomena \n\nBaigrie (2006). Notable contributions came from Hans Christian Ørsted’s discovery of the connection between electricity and magnetism in 1820, demonstrating that an electric current produces a magnetic field, and the efforts of Michael Faraday to quantitatively relate electric and magnetic forces. However, it was James Clerk Maxwell who, through his seminal treatise published in 1873, unified the previously fragmented theories into a comprehensive framework \n\nMaxwell (2011), \n\nMaxwell (2011).\n\nMaxwell synthesized prior knowledge within a system of equations describing the interrelation between electric and magnetic fields. A key insight was that these fields could propagate through space as waves, spreading energy outward from a source. One remarkable conclusion was that light itself was simply a high-frequency electromagnetic wave. However, generating such waves to study their properties proved challenging. It was not until 1887 that Heinrich Hertz conclusively demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves \n\nShamos (1987).\n\nIn his laboratory, Hertz sought to generate and detect the elusive electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell’s equations. To achieve this, he devised an electrical oscillator circuit connected to a dipole antenna. When operated at high voltages, oscillations in the circuit induced corresponding oscillations in the antenna, launching electromagnetic radiation. To detect the waves, Hertz used a separate loop antenna connected to another resonant circuit. When placed in the path of the radiation, oscillations were induced in this receiver loop, providing experimental evidence of propagating electromagnetic waves.\n\nThe apparatus engineered by Hertz definitively confirmed Maxwell’s theories and opened up a new paradigm in physics. Additionally, Hertz measured properties of the waves including polarization, reflection, refraction and interference, verifying that they obeyed the same rules as visible light. This cemented light’s electromagnetic basis.\n\nHertz’s experiments proved that coordinated electrical oscillations could be harnessed to generate and receive wireless signals. However, the capabilities of Hertz’s apparatus were limited. While suitable for laboratory studies, more powerful and efficient oscillators would be needed to enable practical applications like radio communication.\n\nEarly radio transmitters used crude ore detectors and inefficient spark gap generators to produce electromagnetic radiation. Generating steady, high-frequency electrical oscillations was key to enabling continuous wave radio broadcasts. This relied on certain analogies with mechanical oscillators like those used in chronometers. A resonant LC circuit can exhibit oscillations, but losses due to resistance will dampen the oscillations over time. To sustain continuous oscillations, energy must be continually fed into the system, analogous to rewinding the chronometer’s drive spring. In an electronic oscillator, amplifying elements like vacuum tubes are used to replenish the energy dissipated in the resonant tank circuit. This negative resistance precisely counteracts losses, allowing persistent high-frequency oscillations. By maintaining energy balance in an electrical harmonic system, electronic oscillators enabled modern wireless communication.\n\nThe parallels between mechanical and electrical oscillators highlight the continuity in physics concepts across disciplines. Whether weighing a clock’s escapement or balancing amplifiers and dissipation in a radio transmitter, the goal of sustaining an oscillator despite losses united these efforts. Powered by electronic oscillators, radio technology would fundamentally reshape society in the 20th century \n\nClarke (2011).","type":"content","url":"/ch17#harnessing-oscillators-for-wireless-communication","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"17.

Understanding the nonlinear dynamics underlying excitation in neurons and cardiac cells would require integrating concepts from physics, mathematics and biology. Once again, oscillator models would provide vital insights, this time by mimicking the spikes and rhythms produced by biological cells.\n\nThe Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol joined Philips Research Laboratories after receiving his doctorate in 1913. During his time there, he made significant contributions to the field of electronics, especially in radio technology. Van der Pol was a key figure in the development of the Philips radio receiver, which was a huge success at the time. According to one of his biographers, “Radio might have remained a field of haphazard empiricism along with wild commercial ventures, but for the influence of men like Van der Pol who stressed the need for a more scientific approach” \n\nBremmer et al. (1960).\n\nIn 1926, van der Pol derived a nonlinear differential equation to describe the behavior of vacuum tube circuits used in early radios. While analyzing his model equations, van der Pol made an intriguing discovery. When the value of a parameter known as the damping coefficient was small, the system exhibited the familiar traits of a harmonic oscillator. However, as the damping coefficient increased to larger values, the model solutions diverged from the conventional behavior of harmonic oscillators. Instead of following smooth periodic sinusoidal oscillations, the model solutions displayed alternating periods of rapid and slow changes. Van der Pol coined the term “relaxation oscillations” to describe this behavior \n\nPol (1926).\n\nThe spiking behavior of Van der Pol oscilator was analogous to the action potentials transmitted along neurons and the cells of the heart pacemaker. Building on this, van der Por created a circuit with three oscillators to reproduce the electrical behavior of the heart. Using this method, he successfully replicated specific cardiac arrhythmias, demonstrating the model’s ability to capture the complex dynamics of cardiac electrical activity \n\nPol & Mark (1928).\n\nIn parallel to the oscillator modeling work, new technologies enabled direct measurements of neural electrical signals. The development of operational amplifiers (op-amps) in the early 1940s was a key advance. Op-amps can perform high-gain voltage amplification and mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, integration and differentiation. This made signal processing and analysis much more feasible. In 1949, Kenneth Cole and Howard Curtis invented the voltage clamp technique using an op-amp based feedback circuit to control the voltage across a cell membrane \n\nBrown (2020). This allowed the underlying ionic currents to be precisely measured for the first time.\n\nFundamental discoveries in thermodynamics and physical chemistry by pioneers like Max Planck and Walther Nernst also contributed to understanding the electrical behavior of cell membranes. Nernst’s work led to his eponymous equation in 1889, relating an ion’s equilibrium potential to its concentration gradient. The Nernst-Planck equations described the motion of charged particles, extending diffusion to include electrostatic effects.\n\nAlso important was Cole’s adoption of the squid giant axon as a model for studying membrane electrical properties in 1936, following J. Z. Young’s suggestion. The size and spacious lumen of the squid axon made it more amenable to experimental techniques such as intracellular recording, which were previously impractical with smaller axons.\n\nWhile collaborating with Cole in the 1930s, Hodgkin realized the potential of using the squid giant axon to record intracellular action potentials. Returning to Cambridge in 1938, he recruited the undergraduate Andrew Huxley. Huxley’s outstanding physics and mathematics background paired with Hodgkin’s neurophysiology expertise. Their collaborative project resulted in a series of papers providing quantitative insights into the biophysical basis of the action potential \n\nBrown (2020).\n\nThe culminating paper in the Hodgkin and Huxley series established the field of quantitative membrane biophysics, integrating mathematical modeling with empirical measurements. Hodgkin and Huxley developed a model of interconnected differential equations and performed painstaking calculations to match the model output to their voltage clamp data. Lacking access to early computers, Huxley relied on a desktop mechanical calculator, achieving remarkable precision.\n\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley model marked a breakthrough in neuroscience, offering the first quantitative, mechanistic picture of neural excitability. Their integrative approach combining math and biology yielded insights into ion channel function while spurring new fields like computational neuroscience. This achievement emerged from interdisciplinary collaboration, as experts in physics, mathematics and physiology united around the common goal of demystifying the action potential. The Hodgkin-Huxley collaboration highlights the power of bridging disciplinary divides to propel discovery.\n\nThe complexity of the Hodgkin-Huxley model posed challenges for broader usage in an era before digital computers. In the 1960s, Richard FitzHugh at the NIH sought to investigate the model’s mathematical properties using nonlinear dynamics techniques. To solve the equations across parameters, FitzHugh collaborated with John Moore to build an analog computer from op-amps, multipliers and plotters \n\nIzhikevich & FitzHugh (2006). This allowed them to graphically visualize solutions, though operating the intricate analog simulator required sophisticated engineering and math skills. The model complexity and lack of digital computing motivated efforts to derive simplified models of neural excitation.\n\nGuided by Cole’s insights, FitzHugh modified van der Pol’s relaxation oscillator equations to distinguish key features of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The aim was to separate the dynamics of sodium and potassium ion flow across the membrane from the regenerative excitation process. Originally called the Bonhoeffer-van der Pol equations, these were later renamed the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations because, around the same time, Japanese engineer Jin-Ichi Nagumo invented an electronic circuit using tunnel diodes that reproduced the key cubic nonlinearity. The simplified FitzHugh-Nagumo model provided an accessible approximation to the complex Hodgkin-Huxley system. Reconfiguring the analog computer to solve these reduced equations enabled more extensive mathematical analyses of neural excitation dynamics.\n\nThe quest to understand the electrical basis of neural signaling exemplifies the potency of cross-disciplinary pollination. Integrating oscillator models from physics and engineering with emerging techniques to probe nerve impulses yielded insights into the mechanisms of neural excitation. Constructing fruitful analogies between biological and man-made oscillators led to accessible mathematical representations that captured the essence of spiking dynamics. By breaking down barriers between physics, mathematics and physiology, pioneers transformed understanding of the fundamental processes underlying thought itself. The intertwined narrative of biological and technological oscillators underscores how synthesizing diverse perspectives propels discovery.","type":"content","url":"/ch17#modelling-neural-excitation-with-oscillators","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"17.

At its simplest, a harmonic oscillator describes the oscillatory motion of a mass attached to an ideal linear spring. Due to the restoring force exerted by the spring in response to displacement from equilibrium, the motion takes the form of simple harmonic oscillations.\n\nMore generally, any physical system that displays oscillatory behavior about an equilibrium point can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator, provided the restoring force is proportional to displacement and acts in the opposite direction. Examples include the vibrations of molecules, pendulums with small amplitude swings, electrical circuits containing inductors and capacitors, and even whole organs or organisms displaying rhythmic dynamics like the beating of the heart or circadian rhythms.\n\nIn reality, no oscillator is truly isolated from its environment. Damping forces arising from friction or dissipation act to sap the oscillator’s energy over time. This gives rise to the damped harmonic oscillator model, where a force proportional but opposed to velocity is included. The damped harmonic oscillator provides a minimal yet remarkably versatile modeling framework applicable across science and engineering.\n\nIn this chapter, we introduce the damped harmonic oscillator differential equation from three physical perspectives: a mass-spring system, a pendulum, and an electrical RLC circuit.

However, a more rigorous understanding of these oscillator systems was needed to facilitate their further development and practical applications.\n\nIn 1926, the Dutch physicist Balthasar van der Pol made seminal progress in this area with his oscillator model. Van der Pol recognized that amplifiers behave as negative resistors at low oscillation amplitudes, effectively amplifying signals. In an ideal system, an amplifier could then induce ever-growing oscillations by substituting the resistor in an RCL circuit. However, van der Pol also realized that unbounded growth was not observed in practice, suggesting the presence of a mechanism curtailing growth.\n\nTo address this, van der Pol introduced a model term that mimicked an amplifier at low amplitudes but behaved like a resistor at high amplitudes, limiting oscillation growth. Through analyzing this model, van der Pol demonstrated that under certain parameters, self-sustained oscillations could arise via a distinctive ``relaxation-type\" behavior. This conceptualization of relaxation oscillations was highly influential.\n\nImportantly, van der Pol also recognized the relevance of his model to describing the rhythmic electrical activity underlying cardiac pacemaker cells.

However, when the trajectory reaches a local maximum or minimum of the lateral branch, where it meets the unstable middle branch of the x-nullcline, it is unable to continue progressing along the middle branch. Instead, it abruptly jumps to the opposite lateral branch. Specifically, a trajectory descends the left branch until the local minimum, at which point it cannot progress further and abruptly jumps rightward to ascend the rising right branch instead. Similarly, upon reaching the local maximum of the right branch, the trajectory jumps left to descend along the left branch once more.\n\nThis rapid approach and slow movement along the stable branches, interrupted by abrupt jumps between branches at turning points, gives rise to the characteristic relaxation oscillations observed in the van der Pol oscillator when \\mu \\gg 2. The system alternates between episodes of rapid evolution and sluggish progression as it repeatedly hops between the lateral branches of the x-nullcline. This peculiar oscillatory behavior distinguishes relaxation oscillators from conventional sinusoidal oscillations.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Phase portrait for \\mu\\gg 2 illustrating relaxation oscillations.

This model, developed by Balthasar van der Pol in 1926, marked the first appearance of the concept of relaxation oscillations in physics and mathematics. By incorporating a nonlinear damping term into the harmonic oscillator equation, van der Pol was able to capture a peculiar oscillatory phenomenon characterized by alternating episodes of rapid change and slow progression between stable solutions.\n\nThe relaxation oscillations exhibited by the van der Pol system in the limit of large damping parameter \\mu distinguishes it fundamentally from conventional harmonic motion. This characteristic oscillatory behavior arises from the system’s tendency to rapidly approach one lateral branch of the x-nullcline before abruptly switching to the other branch at local extremes.\n\nHistorically, the van der Pol oscillator played a pivotal role in conceptualizing relaxation oscillations and establishing them as a unique class of self-sustained oscillation distinct from sinusoidal waveforms.

In neuroscience, they have helped quantify electrical spiking patterns in excitable cells like neurons. In cardiovascular physiology, relaxation oscillations resemble pressure-volume loops associated with the heartbeat.\n\nBy deriving the first model exhibiting relaxation oscillations, van der Pol laid foundations not only for oscillator theory but also quantitative modeling applications to biological rhythms.

The van der Pol oscillator provided a simple representation of self-sustained oscillations in autoexcitable systems like the heart. However, it did not account for the distinct properties of neurons and other excitable cells that require an external stimulus to trigger an action potential.\n\nA breakthrough came with the Hodgkin-Huxley model in the 1950s. Through pioneering experimental and theoretical work, Hodgkin and Huxley developed the first quantitatively accurate model of neuronal excitation. They showed that action potentials result from non-linear interactions between voltage-gated sodium and potassium ion channels and membrane potential. This established the foundations of computational neuroscience and quantitative modeling of excitable cells.\n\nHowever, the Hodgkin-Huxley model is complex, with four non-linear differential equations and multiple voltage-dependent gating variables. This complexity limited analytical insights and computation. A simpler explanatory model was needed to better understand the general principles governing excitability and oscillatory behavior in nerve and muscle fibers.\n\nIn the early 1960s, FitzHugh and Nagumo independently developed minimal two-variable models of neuronal excitability that captured the essence of excitable dynamics while removing biochemical details. These ``reduced\" models provided a mathematically tractable framework for analyzing properties like excitation thresholds and traveling waves.\n\nThe goal of this chapter is to introduce the FitzHugh-Nagumo model and analyze its dynamics.

Prior to it, neuronal signaling was conceptualized in an oversimplified binary framework, with neurons considered to either fire an action potential or remain inactive. Hodgkin and Huxley shattered this notion by quantifying the ionic underpinnings of excitation. They established that the action potential results from finely coordinated ion movements, firmly establishing membrane biophysics as a quantitative discipline.\n\nIt is important to understand the historical context preceding this landmark achievement. In the 1930s, Cole and Curtis developed the voltage-clamp technique, permitting direct measurement of membrane ionic currents for the first time. This opened new insights into neural membrane properties. Further, Hodgkin made pioneering intracellular recordings of the action potential in squid giant axons in the late 1940s, providing new data but leaving the precise mechanisms unclear. Building on these foundations, Hodgkin joined efforts with Huxley at Cambridge University in the early 1950s. Through ingenious experimentation and quantitative modeling, they elucidated the molecular sequence of events underlying excitation. Their paired experimental and theoretical work effectively solved the mystery of how ions propagating an electrical signal across neural membranes.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Equivalent circuit diagram of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The membrane is represented as a capacitor separating two ionic solutions of different concentration. Conductances for sodium (g_{Na})\n\nConceptually, Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the cell membrane as a capacitor separating two ionic solutions of differing concentration: the extracellular medium and the cytoplasm. To explain ion flux dynamics, they proposed the existence of transmembrane structures, now known as ion channels, that were selectively permeable to ions like sodium and potassium. critically, Hodgkin and Huxley hypothesized that these channels acted as variable resistors in parallel with the membrane capacitor.\n\nBased on this ionic hypothesis, they developed the equivalent circuit diagram shown in Fig. \n\nFigure 1 to mathematically describe dynamic electric behavior in excitable cells. The governing equation for this circuit is:I = C_M \\frac{dV_M}{dt} + g_{Na} (V_M - V_{NA}) + g_{K} (V_M - V_{K}) + g_{L} (V_M - V_{L}),\n\nwhere I represents the total membrane current per unit area, C_M is the membrane capacitance, g_{Na} and g_K are the sodium and potassium conductances, V_{Na} and V_K are the ion reversal potentials, and g_L and V_L characterize leak conductance and potential. The reversal potential is the membrane voltage at which net ion flow is zero. Ion flux results from electrochemical gradients comprising concentration differences and voltage potentials. At equilibrium, these counteracting forces balance and establish the reversal potential with no net ion movement. Leak currents, mediated by open leak channels permeable to ions like potassium, sodium and chloride, provide a small continuous current important for maintaining the resting potential.\n\nIn Figure \n\nFigure 1, the sodium and potassium resistors are depicted as variable to model their voltage dependence. Hodgkin and Huxley postulated that each ion channel consists of several subunits that can individually transition between open and closed conformations. They proposed that the entire channel only conducts ions when all subunits adopt the open state. To mathematically represent this, Hodgkin and Huxley defined the sodium and potassium conductances as:g_{Na}  = \\bar{g}_{Na} m^3 h,g_K  = \\bar{g}_K n^4.\n\nwhere m, h, and n refer to the fraction of subunits in the open state for their respective channels. It was later discovered that voltage-gated sodium channels contain three identical subunits plus one distinct subunit, while potassium channels contain four identical subunits.\n\nHodgkin and Huxley modeled the dynamics of subunit conformational changes with:\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\alpha_m(V_M) (1-m) - \\beta_m(V_M) m,\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\alpha_n(V_M) (1-n) - \\beta_n(V_M) n,\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\alpha_h(V_M) (1-h) - \\beta_h(V_M) h,\n\nwhere the transition rates \\alpha_i and \\beta_i depend on membrane potential. For brevity, we omit Hodgkin and Huxley’s specific functional forms for these rates.","type":"content","url":"/ch20#the-hodgkin-huxley-model","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"20.

There was thus a need for simpler models that could retain the essential feature of excitability while facilitating mathematical analysis and simulations. The goal was to distill the Hodgkin-Huxley model down to its bare conceptual minimum in order to understand general principles governing oscillatory and excitable phenomena in nerve and muscle fibers.\n\nThis motivated FitzHugh and Nagumo in the early 1960s to independently develop simplified two-variable models of neuronal excitability that abstracted away biochemical details.

FitzHugh drew inspiration from the van der Pol oscillator, which was known to reproduce properties of autoexcitable systems through a limit cycle behavior.\n\nTo mathematically represent neuronal excitability, FitzHugh modified the van der Pol framework such that the system’s steady state could transition between stable and unstable regimes. He proposed a two-variable formulation involving a fast membrane potential variable V and slower recovery variable R.\n\nThere is some flexibility in how the FitzHugh-Nagumo model is expressed mathematically. A common formulation considers the equations:\\frac{dV}{dt} = f(V) - R + I,\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\epsilon(\\gamma V - R).\n\nThe function f(V) represents a cubic polynomial feedback for the variable V, which can take positive or negative values depending on the magnitude of V. This nonlinear feedback captures the regenerative dynamics underlying excitability. In this common formulation, the nonlinear feedback is defined as:f(V) = V (a - V) (V - b),\n\nwith a < b. The small parameter \\epsilon \\ll 1 establishes a time scale separation between the fast variable V and slower variable R. Physiologically, this reflects the separation between rapid membrane dynamics and slower cytoplasmic processes. Due to its slower time scale, R provides negative feedback to V, mimicking neural recovery mechanisms that return the membrane potential to its resting level following excitation. Finally, the parameter I acts as a constant input current, analogous to leak currents that determine the neuronal resting potential. Together, these features allow the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to reproduce the essential excitable spiking dynamics in a simplified mathematical framework.","type":"content","url":"/ch20#derivation-of-the-fitzhugh-nagumo-equations","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"20.

For this system, the V-nullcline corresponds to points where \\dot{V}=0, and the R-nullcline corresponds to points where \\dot{R}=0. Through algebraic manipulation, these nullclines can be written as:R = f(V) + I,R = \\gamma V.\n\nThese nullcline equations are plotted in Figure \n\nFigure 2 for parameter values a=1, b=3, \\gamma=2.2, and three different values of the input current I=0,1,2. We see that when I=0,1, the cubic V-nullcline and linear R-nullcline intersect in the left branch of the cubic where f'(V)<0. In contrast, when I=2 the nullclines intersect in the middle portion where f'(V)>0.\n\n\n\nFigure 2:Nullcline diagrams of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system for different values of the input current I. When I=0 and I=1, the cubic V-nullcline intersects the linear R-nullcline in the left branch where f'(V)<0, yielding a stable fixed point. For I=2, the intersection occurs in the middle branch where f'(V)>0, producing an unstable fixed point.\n\nFixed points correspond to the intersections of the nullclines. To analyze their stability, we calculate the Jacobian matrix:J = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n        f'(V) & -1 \\\\\n        \\epsilon \\gamma & -\\epsilon\n\\end{bmatrix}\n.\n\nAll entries of the Jacobian are constant except for the term f'(V), which changes sign depending on whether the nullcline intersection occurs in the left or middle branch of the cubic.\n\nThe trace (\\tau) and determinant (\\Delta) of the Jacobian are:\\tau = f'(V) - \\epsilon, \\quad \\Delta = \\epsilon (\\gamma - f'(V))\n\nThe stability of the fixed points depends on the signs of the Jacobian trace, \\tau, and determinant, \\Delta. Specifically, if f'(V)<0, the fixed point is stable with \\tau<0 and \\Delta>0. When the condition \\epsilon<f'(V)<\\gamma is satisfied instead, the fixed point becomes an unstable node or spiral, characterized by \\tau>0 and \\Delta>0. Physiologically, we expect the parameter \\epsilon governing the timescale of recovery variable R to be much smaller than 1, since R represents a slower process than the membrane dynamics of V. This is consistent with the condition \\epsilon<f'(V).\n\nIn the following section, we will conduct a phase plane analysis to show that when the fixed point is unstable, it lies within a stable limit cycle orbit. This limit cycle behavior underlies the oscillations exhibited by excitable systems modeled by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equations.","type":"content","url":"/ch20#analysis-of-steady-states","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"20.

In a small neighborhood of the unstable fixed point, the system is topologically equivalent to its linearization. Since both eigenvalues of the Jacobian have positive real parts, all trajectories will flow outward from the fixed point. We can also see in figure \n\nFigure 3 that trajectories far from the origin converge to the V-nullcline to then approach the fixed point. We can apply the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem to show that all trajectory must converge to a limit cycle. The phase space of the FitzHugh-Nagumo system is the plane, which has no singular points. Furthermore, the vector field describing the system is continuous and smooth. Therefore, by the Poincaré-Bendixson theorem, any bounded non-wandering trajectory in the plane must asymptotically approach a fixed point or a limit cycle. However, the only fixed point is unstable, so trajectories cannot approach it. The bounded trajectories must therefore converge to a periodic orbit, namely a stable limit cycle.\n\n\n\nFigure 3:Phase portraits of the FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator for parameter values a=1, b=3, \\gamma=2, and 2 different values of parameter \\epsilon, overlaid with nullclines.

In the phase plane portrait shown in Figure \n\nFigure 4, the intersection of the nullclines occurs along the middle branch of the cubic curve, where the slope f'(x) < 0, rendering the fixed point unstable. This instability positions the system within the basin of attraction of a stable limit cycle.\n\nTo understand the trajectory of the limit cycle oscillation, we can examine the vector field flow. When the system is near the left cubic branch, the vector field points sharply to the right, rapidly driving the trajectory upward along the branch. This corresponds to the swift rise of the membrane potential toward its peak value during an action potential. Once the trajectory crosses the cubic branch at its local maximum, the vector field reverses direction, sharply pointing leftward. This causes a rapid decline in the membrane potential as it descends along the left branch. Meanwhile, the recovery variable R continues to move slowly leftward along its linear branch due to its longer timescale (\\gamma \\ll 1).\n\nEventually, R pulls the trajectory below the cubic branch at a local minimum. At this juncture, the vector field reverses again, and the membrane potential begins a slow ascent along the right cubic branch as R decreases. This gradual motion along the branch represents the extended falling phase and undershoot period of a relaxation oscillation. Consequently, the limit cycle trajectory alternates between rapid excursions along the lateral cubic branches, representing the spike phases, and slower movements along the branches during the falling and recovery phases. This oscillatory behavior closely mimics the characteristic relaxation oscillations observed in autoexcitable systems, such as the van der Pol oscillator and cardiac pacemaker cells.\n\n\n\nFigure 4:Phase portrait for \\gamma\\ll 1 illustrating relaxation oscillations.

In this section, we test this assumption by directly comparing key properties of the full and approximated systems.\n\nFirst, we analyze the reduced 1D quasi-steady state approximation given by Eq. \n\n(12). At steady state, the time derivative must equal zero, yielding the steady state condition x^* = f(g(x^*)).\n\nTo assess the stability of the system, we can perform a linear stability analysis.

This allows the one-dimensional reduced approximation, which focuses solely on the slow component v_1, to accurately describe the system’s behavior near steady states that are comparable to those of the full system.

Hematopoiesis Regulation","lvl2":"Hematopoiesis Physiology"},"content":"Hematopoiesis is the process of blood cell production that continuously replenishes various circulating cell types. This ensures a healthy supply of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets, which all play crucial roles in oxygen transport, immune defense, and hemostasis.\nThe most common site of blood cell production is the spongy tissue inside bones called bone marrow. Hematopoiesis that occurs in the bone marrow is called medullary hematopoiesis. Less often, hematopoiesis takes place in other parts of the body, like the liver and spleen. Hematopoiesis that occurs outside of the bone marrow is called extramedullary hematopoiesis \n\nJaffe et al. (2024).\n\nRed blood cells, also called erythrocytes, carry oxygen from the lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide back to the lungs. They are the most abundant cell type in blood. The production of red blood cells is termed erythropoiesis. White blood cells, or leukocytes, fight infection and protect the body from pathogens. They also destroy abnormal cells. Leukocyte production is termed leukopoiesis. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are cell fragments that clump to form clots after injury and create seals in damaged tissue to prevent blood loss. Their production is called thrombopoiesis.\n\nHematopoiesis begins with an originator cell common to all blood cell types. It’s called a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). An HSC develops into a precursor cell, or ``blast\" cell. A precursor cell is on track to become a specific type of blood cell, but it’s still in the early stages. A precursor cell goes through several cell divisions and changes before it becomes a fully mature blood cell.\n\nHematopoiesis is tightly regulated through negative feedback loops that help maintain optimal blood cell levels. When cell concentrations rise in circulation, signals are sent to slow or inhibit further hematopoietic production. This prevents overabundance of cells.\n\nSpecifically for erythropoiesis, elevated red blood cell counts or hemoglobin trigger the kidneys to decrease secretion of erythropoietin (EPO). Since EPO estimulates proliferation and differentiation of red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow, lowered EPO then downregulates these processes. This negative feedback mechanism helps stabilize red blood cell production.\n\nA similar process occurs for thrombopoiesis. Higher platelet counts inhibit thrombopoietin secretion by the liver, which dampens megakaryocyte development and thrombopoiesis in the bone marrow.\n\nMeanwhile, leukocyte regulation involves feedback suppression via certain cytokines. Immune cells secrete less of growth factors like G-CSF and GM-CSF when higher leukocyte levels are detected. This decreased cytokine stimulation, in turn, curbs further leukopoiesis.\n\nMature circulating blood cells provide another level of negative feedback regulation. As their numbers increase systemically, fully differentiated cells secrete signaling molecules that act to inhibit further proliferation and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow niche. This feedback mechanism helps balance the production of new cells from the HSC pools with the clearance of older senescent cells from circulation.\n\nAs new blood cells are generated, aging cells are cleared through specialized elimination pathways. Mature red blood cells, with their biconcave disc morphology, are superbly adapted for oxygen transport as they flexibly navigate narrow vasculature. However, after approximately 120 days in circulation, they become increasingly fragile. Macrophages in the spleen and liver then break down senescent erythrocytes.\n\nUpon fulfilling their immune duties, white blood cells undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis. Lifespans vary considerably by subtype, from roughly one day for granulocytes like neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils, to months for B cells, and even decades for memory T cells.\n\nPlatelets, as small cytoplastic fragments released from megakaryocytes, play a vital role in initiating clot formation. Yet due to their inherent fragility, platelets are removed from circulation after about 10 days as they become progressively less sturdy.\n\nPrecise coordination between ongoing production and timely degradation of aging cells through specialized pathways ensures the balanced homeostasis of distinct blood cell populations essential for normal physiological functioning. Close regulation at both stages is critical for maintaining healthy hematopoiesis.","type":"content","url":"/ch22#hematopoiesis-physiology","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"22.

He attended Blundell’s School in Tiverton, where he demonstrated academic promise and was awarded scholarships to Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, Hill studied mathematics and achieved Third Wrangler status on the prestigious Mathematical Tripos examination in 1907.\n\nUpon graduation, Hill was encouraged by his professor Walter Morley Fletcher to pursue physiology. While still an undergraduate, Hill published his first paper deriving what became known as the Langmuir equation. Under the supervision of John Newport Langley, Hill’s 1909 publication derived both equilibrium and exponential association forms of the Langmuir isotherm to model nicotine and curare binding at neuromuscular junctions. This work represented an important early application of receptor theory.\n\nIn 1910, Hill was awarded a fellowship at Trinity College. He spent the following winter of 1910-1911 in Germany conducting research. From 1911-1914 at Cambridge, Hill continued his investigations of muscle contraction physiology while also studying nerve impulse transmission, hemoglobin binding properties, and animal calorimetry—collaborating with eminent scientists including Gaskell, Barcroft and Adrian.\n\nBy 1914, Hill had been appointed University Lecturer in Physical Chemistry at Cambridge, showing early interdisciplinary interests. During World War I, he served as an artillery officer in the Royal Garrison Artillery, rising to the rank of Major and directing experimental research sections. Hill’s distinguished early career foreshadowed his later contributions to quantitative physiology.","type":"content","url":"/ch23#education-and-early-career","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"23.

After the war, Hill returned to Cambridge before accepting a faculty chair at Manchester University :cite:Bassett2002.\n\nUsing calorimetry techniques, Hill measured the heat produced during different phases of muscle contraction. This allowed him to correlate metabolic heat with biochemical and cellular events underlying muscle function. For this work elucidating muscle energetics, Hill received the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.\n\nThrough force measurements and biochemical analysis, Hill identified distinct phases of the muscle contraction-relaxation cycle. He discovered the dependence of muscle power output on velocity of shortening.\n\nIn 1923, Hill accepted a professorship at University College London where he continued research on muscle biomechanics and energetics.\n\nIn 1938, Hill proposed his influential three-element muscle model to account for experimental observations of contraction force, velocity relationships, and heat production dynamics. The model conceptualized the muscle as consisting of contractile, parallel elastic and series elastic elements. The contractile element, comprising actin and myosin filaments, generates force during activation and is responsible for shortening. The parallel and series elements represent passive connective tissue forces and intrinsic fiber elasticity, respectively.\n\nHill’s model integrated biomechanical, biochemical and energetic aspects of muscle function into a unified quantitative framework. It proved highly influential and was verified by later experimental studies. Throughout the 1950s, Hill continued multidisciplinary muscle investigations using techniques such as calorimetry, biochemistry and force measurements. His work established foundations for modern structural and molecular models of muscle contraction.","type":"content","url":"/ch23#studies-on-muscle-physiology","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"23.

Receptors act as signalling molecules that initiate intracellular responses upon binding to extracellular ligands. Some examples of important ligand-receptor systems include hormone-receptor interactions regulating metabolic functions, immunological reactions mediated via antigen-antibody binding, and neurotransmission via neurotransmitter receptors in the nervous system. Proper understanding of the dynamics of ligand-receptor binding is fundamental to elucidating the mechanisms of various physiological and pathological processes.\n\nChemical kinetics provides a powerful framework to mathematically model and analyze ligand-receptor interactions. In this chapter, we develop a kinetic framework to describe the dynamics of ligand binding to cell surface receptors. We start from the simplest case of a single ligand binding to a receptor with a single binding site. We then extend this model to account for receptors with an arbitrary number of independent binding sites. Finally, we incorporate the phenomenon of cooperativity in ligand binding to model more complex receptor systems.\n\nIn this chapter we discuss the basic concepts of chemical reactions relevant to ligand-receptor binding, introduce chemical kinetics and derivate the rate equations based on mass-action law, present kinetic models for single-site and multi-site binding and extend these models to cooperative binding.","type":"content","url":"/ch24#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"24.

Ligand-receptor binding can be regarded as a chemical reaction between the reactants, ligand (\\text{L}) and free receptor (\\text{R}), converting to products bound ligand-receptor complex (\\text{R}_L).\n\nBased on their molecular steps, chemical reactions can be categorized as elementary or non-elementary. Elementary reactions involve a single concerted reaction step where all reactants are transformed to products simultaneously. Ligand-receptor binding often approximates an elementary reaction process where the ligand directly binds to the receptor in a single step without forming any intermediate complexes.\n\nIn addition, chemical reactions can either be reversible or irreversible. The binding of ligand to receptor is generally reversible in nature, which allows the complex to dissociate back to free entities. The reaction representing ligand-receptor binding can thus be written as:\\text{L} + \\text{R} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{R}_L.\n\nHere, the forward reaction represents ligand binding to receptor to form the complex \\text{R}_L, while the reverse reaction denotes dissociation of the complex back to free ligand and receptor.

For elementary reactions involving single reaction steps like ligand-receptor binding, kinetics theory relies on the law of mass action.\n\nThe law of mass action states that the rate of a reaction is directly proportional to the active collision frequency of reactants. This is because for the reaction to occur, the reactant molecules must collide with sufficient energy and correct orientation for the reaction to take place. The frequency of successful collisions is directly proportional to the chance of reactants meeting. This chance is given by the product of their concentrations at the reaction site. Therefore, the reaction rate is proportional to the product of reactant concentrations.\n\nWe use square brackets ([\\cdot]) to represent the molar concentrations of species in a solution. The concentrations as opposed to amounts or numbers give an indication of how dense or dilute the reactants and products are in the reaction volume. This is important because reaction rates depend on the volume as well as amounts of substances present.\n\nFor the reversible binding reaction in Eq. \n\n(1), application of the law of mass action gives:\\begin{align*}\nv_{\\text{forward}} &= k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{L}][\\text{R}], \\\\\nv_{\\text{reverse}} &= k_{\\text{off}}[\\text{R}_L].\n\\end{align*}\n\nA reaction is said to be at chemical equilibrium when the forward and reverse reaction rates become equal, such that there is no further change in concentrations with time.

Ligand-Receptor Dynamics","lvl2":"Saturation Fraction, Cooperativity and the Hill Function"},"content":"In ligand-binding experiments, the saturation fraction (\\sigma) is typically measured. This represents the fraction of receptor binding sites that are bound ligands. Specifically, \\sigma is calculated as the ratio of total ligand-occupied binding sites to the total number of binding sites across all receptors. For receptors with n binding sites that bind ligand cooperatively, \\sigma can be expressed as—see Eq. \n\n(21):\\sigma = \\frac{\\sum_{m=0}^n m [\\text{R}_{mL}]}{n [\\text{R}_T]} = \\frac{\\sum_{m=0}^n \\binom{n}{m} m \\left[\\frac{[\\text{L}]}{K_A^{(n-m)/2}K_H}\\right]^m}{\\sum_{m=0}^n \\binom{n}{m} n \\left[\\frac{[\\text{L}]}{K_A^{(n-m)/2}K_H}\\right]^m}\n\nWhen the cooperativity factor K_A equals 1, indicating no cooperativity, Eq. \n\n(24) simplifies to:\\sigma = \\frac{[\\text{L}]}{[\\text{L}] + K_H}.\n\nMoreover, we have from its definition that K_H = K_D. In other words, in this case of no cooperativity we can equivalently think of there being a concentration of n[\\text{R}_T] single-site receptors instead of [\\text{R}_T] multi-site receptors. Eq. \n\n(25) then takes the well-known Michaelis-Menten form, with the property that \\sigma is 0 when [\\text{L}] is 0, increases linearly at low [\\text{L}], equals 1/2 when [\\text{L}] = K_H, and saturates to 1 as [\\text{L}] becomes very large.\n\nIn the limit of very high cooperativity (K_A \\to \\infty), [\\text{R}_{mL}] approaches 0 for m = 1 to n-1—see Eq. \n\n(23). Therefore, Eq. \n\n(24) reduces to the equation:\\sigma = \\frac{0 [\\text{R}] + n [\\text{R}_{nL}]}{n [\\text{R}] + n [\\text{R}_{nL}]} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_H^n + [L]^n}.\n\nThis equation resembles the Michaelis-Menten equation but has an initial zero slope and a sigmoidal shape. The steepness at [\\text{L}] = K_H, where \\sigma = 1/2, depends on n. Large n values give nearly switch-like sigmoidal behavior—see the bottom panel of Fig. \n\nFigure 1.\n\nFor finite cooperativity factors K_A, the saturation fraction \\sigma given by Eq. \n\n(24) also exhibits sigmoidal behavior as a function of ligand concentration [\\text{L}]—top panel of Fig. \n\nFigure 1. The sigmoid curve starts at the origin, reaches half-saturation where \\sigma = 1/2 at [L] = K_H, and approaches full saturation with \\sigma \\rightarrow 1 as [\\text{L}] becomes very large. The steepness of the sigmoid curve at the half-saturation point [\\text{L}] = K_H is determined by the magnitude of K_A. Specifically, higher K_A values produce steeper sigmoidal curves, indicating that ligand binding occurs in a more cooperative or concerted fashion. Thus, K_A not only influences whether ligand binding is cooperative versus independent, but also modulates the degree of cooperativity as characterized by the steepness of the saturation fraction curve at K_H. In summary, both the number of binding sites n and the cooperativity factor K_A help determine the switching behavior of the system in its transition from the unbound to fully bound state.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Top panel. Plots of the saturation fraction \\sigma given by Eq. \n\n(24) For various finite cooperativity factors K_A and the limit K_A \\to \\infty. Bottom panel. Plots of the Hill function with growing Hill exponents up to n_H = 4.0.\n\nThe British physiologist A.V. Hill recognized that varying a single parameter in his equation could qualitatively replicate the effects of changing the cooperativity factor K_A from one to infinity. Specifically, he proposed the equation (now bearing his name):\\sigma = \\frac{[\\text{L}]^{n_H}}{[\\text{L}]^{n_H} + K_H^{n_H}},\n\nwhere n_H is a new parameter that can be continuously varied between 0 and the maximum number of binding sites per receptor, n. Just as increasing K_A made the binding curve steeper, larger n_H values also produce a sharper sigmoidal shape. Therefore, the Hill equation captures the essence of cooperative binding through a single tunable exponent rather than two separate parameters (K_A and n).\n\nThis elegantly simplified description proved invaluable for analyzing ligand-binding data. By fitting experimental saturation fractions to the Hill equation, the degree of cooperativity could be estimated from a single parameter, n_H. Since its introduction, the Hill equation has become widely adopted for modeling systems exhibiting sigmoidal saturation behavior, including cooperative ligand-receptor interactions and many other biological switch-like responses. Its popularity stems from providing a tractable phenomenological description of cooperativity using a single cooperativity index.","type":"content","url":"/ch24#saturation-fraction-cooperativity-and-the-hill-function","position":15},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"24.

The narrative explores the tension and eventual synthesis between two burgeoning schools of thought: the Structural School, which utilized X-ray crystallography to visualize the architecture of macromolecules, and the Informational School, which applied quantum mechanical intuition to treat the gene as a “code-script.” We also highlight the critical, often independent contributions of French researchers to gene regulation and enzymatic control. This cross-disciplinary dialogue—bridging physics, chemistry, and genetics—culminated in the 1953 determination of the DNA double helix. By unifying biological function with molecular structure, this milestone provided the mechanistic basis for heredity and established molecular biology as the primary framework for modern life sciences.","type":"content","url":"/ch25","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

In 1900, nearly 40 years after Mendel’s  experiments with pea plants, his work was independently rediscovered by three European botanists: Hugo de Vries in the Netherlands, Carl Correns in Germany, and Erich von Tschermak in Austria. They confirmed Mendel’s laws of inheritance through experiments with other plant species.\n\nThis sparked a revival of interest in genetic research. In 1902, the American zoologist Walter Sutton suggested that chromosomes may be the physical supports of Mendel’s hypothetical units of inheritance, which he called “genes”. Then in 1910, Thomas Hunt Morgan began using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to study genetics at Columbia University. Through analyzing the inheritance of different traits in crossbred flies over many generations, Morgan and his colleagues were able to show that genes have a fixed position on chromosomes. They eventually created the first genetic map locating genes in a linear order on the chromosomes.\n\nA major breakthrough occurred in 1928 when German botanist and geneticist Friedrich Miescher discovered that chromosomes contain a nucleic acid, which he called “nuclein”. Later investigations in the 1930s determined that there were two main types of nucleic acids: DNA and RNA. However, the physical nature and function of genes remained unclear, though it was increasingly believed they must have a molecular basis. Then in 1944, Oswald Avery’s experiments at Rockefeller University provided the decisive evidence that DNA is the genetic material of life, able to replicate itself and determine inheritance of traits.\n\nThis set the stage for the great discoveries to follow in the post-World War 2 era that would establish molecular biology as a distinct field, cracking open the secrets of heredity and life at the level of macromolecules and unraveling the molecular mechanisms of genetics.\n\nReaders seeking a deeper understanding of the topics covered in this chapter are encouraged to consult the following sources: \n\nWatson (1968), \n\nStent (1968), \n\nPerutz (1987), \n\nWeiner (1999), \n\nBurian & Gayon (1999), \n\nMoore (2015).","type":"content","url":"/ch25#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

The Interdisciplinary Origins of Molecular Biology","lvl2":"Early Steps Towards a Physical and Molecular View of Genes"},"content":"While Avery’s experiments cemented DNA as the genetic material, understanding how it specified traits required further elucidation of genes’ physical nature. Early insights came through Morgan’s studies of Drosophila genetics at Columbia in the early 1900s. Examining inheritance patterns of traits like eye color in fruit fly offspring, Morgan and his “fly room” colleagues discovered that genes appear to be located on chromosomes and pass from parents to offspring in specific arrangements during cell division. They were able to construct the first genetic maps ordering genes along the fly’s four chromosomes.\n\nOther key advances included Herman Muller’s discovery in 1926 that X-rays could sharply increase mutation rates in Drosophila, providing evidence that genes correspond to discrete chromosomal locations that can be damaged. Meanwhile, in the 1930s at Rockefeller Institute, Avery along with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty identified DNA as the active component of the transforming principle—the substance enabling bacteria to change identity—in a series of classic experiments on pneumococcal bacteria.\n\nThis work established DNA as the chemical support of inheritance and genes. However, the exact physical nature of genes as material units within DNA was still unknown. Answers began emerging from the so-called “Morgan School” of genetics centered at Columbia. Through painstaking analysis of inheritance patterns in many fruit fly generations, Morgan’s students were able to demonstrate that genes are arranged linearly along chromosomes like beads on a string. This supported the concrete view of genes as real, localized molecular entities rather than abstract concepts. Their efforts led to the first linkage maps of the Drosophila genome ordering many fruit fly genes.","type":"content","url":"/ch25#early-steps-towards-a-physical-and-molecular-view-of-genes","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

The Interdisciplinary Origins of Molecular Biology","lvl2":"The Structural School in Molecular Biology"},"content":"With genetics increasingly focused on genes’ material basis, researchers sought techniques to elucidate molecules’ three-dimensional structures. Pioneering this area known as molecular structuralism was the field of X-ray crystallography, launched in 1912 through the work of British physicists William and Lawrence Bragg at the University of Leeds. Using X-rays to analyze regular crystal structures, they devised the Bragg equation allowing precise calculations of inter-atomic distances based on diffraction pattern measurements.\n\nThe Bragg father and son established Cambridge University’s renowned crystallographic laboratory in 1915. There, scientists like William Astbury and John Desmond Bernal applied X-ray crystallography to analyze larger biological molecules. In the late 1930s, they obtained the first low-resolution structures of proteins like keratin. Around this time, Astbury also discovered the common structural motif of stacked nucleotide bases running perpendicular to DNA molecules’ long axes.\n\nMeanwhile, Linus Pauling at the California Institute of Technology used both crystallography and modeling to propose alpha helices as the dominant secondary structure within proteins. Published in 1951, this successfully explained experimental X-ray patterns and represented a breakthrough for structural biology. Pauling’s innovative approach earned him the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Back at Cambridge, Max Perutz and John Kendrew were deciphering hemoglobin and myoglobin’s complex three-dimensional atomic architectures through X-ray crystallography of protein crystals, validated by electron microscopy. Their accomplishments gained the 1962 Chemistry Nobel.\n\nThis “Cambridge school” and Pauling exemplified the emerging structuralist approach, seeking to understand biology through high-resolution visualization of molecules’ physical forms. Their work convincingly demonstrated genes’ material basis as nucleic acid and protein structures amenable to physical-chemical analyses. This set the stage for molecular insights into biological functions like oxygen transport and storage of genetic information.","type":"content","url":"/ch25#the-structural-school-in-molecular-biology","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

The Interdisciplinary Origins of Molecular Biology","lvl2":"The Informational School and its Origins in Quantum Physics"},"content":"While structuralism dominated early molecular biology, an alternative “informational” view developed stressing genetic function over form. Pioneering this school was Danish physicist Niels Bohr, a founding father of quantum mechanics. In the 1930s, Bohr explored biology’s interface with physics and proposed that life’s phenomena may not be fully explained by classical concepts alone. He advocated considering organisms as unique, indivisible entities subject to an analog of Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle.\n\nBohr’s ideas greatly influenced German biophysicist Max Delbrück. Delbrück pursued interests in mutation and inheritance through collaboration with geneticist Nikolai Timofeeff-Ressovsky in 1930s Berlin. Their 1935 paper proposing ionizing radiation causes mutations by interacting quantally with genes inspired Erwin Schrödinger’s later writings.\n\nIn 1943-44, as WW2 raged in Europe, Schrödinger delivered a notable series of lectures in Dublin that served as origin for his influential book What is Life?. Building on Delbrück and Timofeeff-Ressovsky’s work, Schrödinger emphasized genetics as transmission and execution of an “aperiodic crystal” storing coded instructions, which he presciently suggested could be a large molecule like DNA.\n\nSchrödinger’s text exposed the problem of genetics to a wide scientific audience and helped attract young physicists into exploring life’s molecular basis. Foremost among them was Delbrück himself, who fled Nazi Germany for research with bacteriophage viruses at Vanderbilt University and the California Institute of Technology. Collaborating with Italian-born Salvador Luria from 1939-40, Delbrück made seminal discoveries validating statistical laws of bacterial mutation proposed by experimental genetics. Their combined efforts established phage as model systems and laid foundations for molecular genetics.","type":"content","url":"/ch25#the-informational-school-and-its-origins-in-quantum-physics","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

Several pioneers worked largely independently in French institutions during and after World War II.\n\nAndré Lwoff studied microbiology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, where in 1950 he discovered lysogeny—how some viruses can insert their genes into bacterial chromosomes without killing the host. This opened perspectives on gene regulation. Meanwhile, at the Collège de France and CNRS, François Jacob and Jacques Monod began investigating how E. coli switches between metabolizing lactose and glucose.\n\nIn 1961 at the Pasteur Institute, they revealed a genetic control system where the lac repressor protein prevents lactose operon expression unless lactose or its isomer allolactose is present. This constituted the first detailed example of gene regulation, demonstrating precisely how environmental inputs control transcriptional activity. The same year, Jacob, Monod, and Lwoff received the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering genetic regulatory mechanisms in bacteria.\n\nAnother Pasteur scientist, François Gros, made independent contributions around this period through isolating the first restriction enzymes in the 1950s. Restriction enzymes can cut DNA at specific recognition sequences, enabling their use as molecular tools. Later, in the 1960s, genomic research was advanced through genome mapping methods like membrane hybridization developed by French biologist Jean Weil.\n\nThese efforts exemplified productive collaboration even during wartime, as French researchers established their nation as a global center for molecular genetics through basic discoveries in gene regulation, enzyme technology, and genomic analysis foreshadowing the post-DNA era’s explosion of knowledge.","type":"content","url":"/ch25#the-emergence-of-molecular-biology-in-france","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

Inspired by the Schrödinger’s ideas, a new generation of young scientists embraced biological problems with fresh physical perspectives. At the University of Cambridge, American biologist James Watson joined British biophysicist Francis Crick aiming to elucidate DNA’s architecture based on existing legacies of nucleic acid research.\n\nSimultaneously, at King’s College London, Australian biophysicist Maurice Wilkins and post-doc Raymond Gosling were conducting X-ray crystallography experiments on DNA fibres using new techniques like fiber diffraction. Independently, Rosalind Franklin—a British biophysicist at King’s—was photographing exquisitely clear X-ray patterns showing DNA adopted a regular twisted, helical form while in the lattice.\n\nAfter Franklin “Photo 51” was shown to Crick, he and Watson were galvanized with inspiration. Borrowing insights from colleagues like Erwin Chargaff on DNA composition and Linus Pauling on triple-stranded helices, within two years they correctly unveiled B-DNA’s now-iconic twisted ladder structure with pairs of nucleotide bases. Published in 1953, their model instantly explained genes’ replication and immediately took the scientific world by storm.\n\nThough Wilkins, Franklin, and others contributed crucially, Watson and Crick received most acclaim for their intuitive theoretical leap. Their triumph solved biology’s greatest riddle—the basis for heredity—in one stroke by decoding DNA’s symbolic language of life in structural terms. It also marked the true emergence of molecular biology, kickstarting an explosive growth era for genetics as fields like biochemistry integrated with other sciences at life’s most intimate chemical level.","type":"content","url":"/ch25#the-discovery-of-the-double-helix","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"25.

The ability to precisely regulate when, where, and to what extent genes are expressed is essential for the proper functioning, development, and survival of all living organisms.\n\nAt the most basic level, gene regulation determines which genes are transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and subsequently translated into proteins. However, the regulatory mechanisms that govern gene expression are highly complex and involve intricate networks of interactions between DNA, RNA, proteins, and various small molecules.\n\nGene regulation is crucial for many biological processes, including cellular differentiation, developmental patterning, metabolic control, and the response to environmental stimuli.

It can be summarized in two fundamental principles: replication and transcription and translation.\n\nIn general terms, the central dogma establishes that the flow of genetic information follows the pattern: DNA \\rightarrow RNA \\rightarrow Protein. This flow of information can be described in three main stages:\n\nDNA replication: DNA replicates itself through a semi-conservative process, in which each strand of the double helix serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.\n\nTranscription: In this stage, the genetic information contained in a specific region of DNA (a gene) is transcribed into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. This process is carried out by the RNA polymerase enzyme, which reads the nucleotide sequence of the DNA and synthesizes a complementary strand of mRNA.\n\nTranslation: The resulting mRNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids that form a protein. This process occurs in ribosomes, where the mRNA is read, and the corresponding proteins are synthesized according to the genetic code.\n\nIt is important to note that, although the central dogma establishes that information cannot flow from proteins to nucleic acids, some exceptions to this rule have been discovered in certain viruses and unicellular organisms. However, in the vast majority of organisms, the central dogma remains an accurate description of the flow of genetic information.","type":"content","url":"/ch26#the-central-dogma-of-molecular-biology","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"26.

This regulation is essential to ensure that proteins are produced in the appropriate amounts and at the right time and place. One of the key mechanisms of gene regulation involves feedback loops, which generally involve metabolites interacting with transcription factors.\n\nFeedback loops are regulatory circuits in which the final product of a metabolic pathway or biological process influences its own synthesis or degradation. These loops can be negative or positive and play a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and responding appropriately to environmental changes.\n\nIn the case of gene regulation, negative feedback loops are the most common and aim to maintain the levels of certain proteins or metabolites within an optimal range. In these loops, the final product of a metabolic pathway (a metabolite) interacts with a represdor, which is a protein that regulates gene expression by binding to specific regions of DNA.\n\nThe negative feedback loop works as follows.\n\nIn the absence of the metabolite, the repressor cannot bind to the regulatory region of the corresponding gene, allowing its transcription and, consequently, the synthesis of the associated protein.\n\nAs the protein is synthesized, the corresponding metabolite is also produced as a result of its enzymatic activity or its participation in a metabolic pathway. When the levels of the metabolite reach a specific threshold, it binds to the repressor, causing a conformational change that sloows it to bind to the regulatory region of the gene.\n\nAs a result, the transcription of the gene stops, halting further production of the protein and, therefore, reducing the synthesis of the metabolite.\n\nThis negative feedback loop allows maintaining the levels of the metabolite within an optimal range, avoiding excessive accumulation or scarcity of the same.\n\nPositive feedback loops can also be involved in gene regulation, although they are less common. In these loops, the final product of a metabolic pathway or biological process stimulates its own synthesis, leading to an amplification or reinforcement of the process. These loops are important in processes such as cell differentiation, apoptosis (programmed cell death), and the inflammatory response.\n\nIn summary, feedback loops involving metabolites that interact with transcription factors are key mechanisms in gene regulation, allowing precise adjustment of protein and metabolite levels in response to environmental conditions and cellular needs.","type":"content","url":"/ch26#gene-regulatory-networks","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"26.

Gene Regulation","lvl2":"The Amino Acid Tryptophan"},"content":"Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that plays a crucial role in various biological processes. It is one of the 20 standard amino acids used in protein synthesis and is encoded by the UGG codon in the genetic code. Tryptophan is considered an essential amino acid because it cannot be synthesized by humans and other animals, and therefore must be obtained from dietary sources.\n\nTryptophan has several important functions in the body:\n\nProtein synthesis: Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a building block for proteins. It is incorporated into polypeptide chains during translation and is found in a wide range of proteins with diverse functions.\n\nPrecursor for metabolic pathways: Tryptophan is the precursor for several important metabolic pathways. It is involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin, as well as the vitamin niacin (nicotinic acid).\n\nRegulation of biological processes: Tryptophan and its metabolites play a role in regulating various biological processes, including sleep, mood, appetite, and immune function. For example, serotonin, derived from tryptophan, is involved in regulating mood, sleep, and appetite.\n\nStructural and functional roles in proteins: The unique structure of tryptophan, with its aromatic indole ring, allows it to participate in various structural and functional roles within proteins. It can be involved in protein folding, stability, and interactions with other molecules.\n\nTryptophan is found in a variety of dietary sources, including meat, dairy products, nuts, seeds, and some vegetables. However, it is generally present in relatively low quantities compared to other amino acids. Adequate intake of tryptophan is essential for maintaining proper protein synthesis, neurotransmitter balance, and overall health.\n\nDue to its importance in various biological processes, the regulation of tryptophan metabolism is tightly controlled in living organisms. The tryptophan operon, discussed in the next section, is a well-studied example of how bacteria regulate the biosynthesis of this essential amino acid through a complex gene regulatory network.","type":"content","url":"/ch26#the-amino-acid-tryptophan","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"26.

Gene Regulation","lvl2":"The Tryptophan Operon"},"content":"The tryptophan operon is one of the best-studied gene regulation systems in bacteria and serves as a classic example of how negative feedback loops control gene expression in response to the levels of a specific metabolite.\n\nThe tryptophan operon is involved in the biosynthesis of the tryptophan amino acid in bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. This operon contains five structural genes (trpE, trpD, trpC, trpB, and trpA) that encode the enzymes necessary for the synthesis of tryptophan from a precursor called chorismate.\n\nThe regulation of the tryptophan operon is based on a negative feedback mechanism mediated by the TrpR transcriptional repressor and the tryptophan coactivator. Additionally, supplementary mechanisms such as enzyme inhibition and transcriptional attenuation are employed to regulate tryptophan synthesis more precisely.\n\nRepression: in the absence of tryptophan, TrpR is in its inactive conformation and cannot bind to the tryptophan operon, allowing transcription. When tryptophan levels are high, some molecules bind to TrpR, causing a conformational change that allows it to bind to the trp operator, blocking transcription.\n\nEnzyme inhibition: the anthranilate synthase enzyme (encoded by the trpE gene) is allosterically inhibited by tryptophan. When tryptophan levels are high, it binds to the anthranilate synthase enzyme, inhibiting its catalytic activity. This reduces the production of anthranilate, a key precursor in the tryptophan synthesis pathway, thereby decreasing tryptophan synthesis.\n\nTranscriptional attenuation: the leader region of the tryptophan operon mRNA contains a specific sequence that can form alternative secondary structures. In the presence of high levels of tryptophan, a transcriptional termination structure is formed, prematurely stopping transcription. In the absence of of tryptophan, an antiterminator structure is formed, allowing complete transcription of the operon. This attenuation mechanism regulates the expression of the structural genes in response to tryptophan levels.\n\nThese complementary regulation mechanisms allow precise and coordinated control of tryptophan synthesis in bacteria. Enzyme inhibition by tryptophan reduces the activity of a key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. Transcriptional attenuation allows adjusting the transcription rate of the operon based on tryptophan levels. Regulation by the TrpR repressor controls transcription at the level of the entire operon.\n\nThis multi-level regulation prevents excessive accumulation of tryptophan and ensures efficient allocation of cellular resources for the synthesis of this essential amino acid.","type":"content","url":"/ch26#the-tryptophan-operon","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"26.

Gene Regulation","lvl2":"The Tryptophanase Operon"},"content":"The tryptophanase (tna) operon in Escherichia coli encodes the proteins necessary for uptake and metabolism of the amino acid tryptophan as a carbon source in the absence of glucose. The tna operon consists of two structural genes: tnaA and tnaB.\n\nThe tnaA gene codes for the enzyme tryptophanase (TnaA), which metabolizes tryptophan to allow it to be used as a carbon source. The tnaB gene codes for the tryptophan-specific permease TnaB, which transports tryptophan from the extracellular environment into the bacterial cell.\n\nThe expression of the tna operon genes is regulated by 3 different mechanisms:\n\nCatabolite Repression - This mechanism depends on the intracellular glucose level. High glucose leads to low levels of cAMP, which prevents the cAMP-CAP complex from binding to the tna promoter and activating transcription. Low glucose allows cAMP-CAP to bind and activate tna operon expression.\n\nRho (\\rho)-mediated Transcription Termination - The Rho protein can bind to the tnaC leader sequence and prematurely terminate transcription of tnaA and tnaB. However, this termination is suppressed when tryptophan is present in the cytoplasm due to ribosome stalling on the tnaC transcript.\n\nPost-translational Regulation of TnaA - The TnaA enzyme is initially produced in an inactive form clustered into foci. In the stationary phase, these foci disperse and TnaA becomes an active tetrameric enzyme that can metabolize tryptophan. This activation is regulated by an unknown cAMP-CAP independent mechanism related to glucose levels.\n\nAs more TnaB permease is produced from the tna operon, it imports more tryptophan into the cell. This increased tryptophan pool further enhances suppression of the transcription terminator, creating a positive feedback loop that reinforces tna operon expression. The positive feedback from tnaB expression, combined with the multiple regulatory inputs (glucose, tryptophan levels, growth phase), suggests the tna operon could exhibit bistable expression dynamics. At certain inducing conditions, the regulatory circuit may permit two distinct stable states of operon expression.\n\nThe sophisticated regulation of the tna operon exemplifies how bacteria have evolved intricate gene circuits to precisely control metabolism of non-preferred nutrient sources. By integrating various signals, E. coli activates tryptophan utilization only when it is advantageous, while allocating resources preferentially to glucose metabolism when available. The potential for bistable dynamics may further enhance the operon’s responsiveness while preventing futile oscillations.\n\nThis regulatory strategy highlights the remarkable ability of even simple organisms to deploy complex decision-making at the molecular level, optimizing survival and growth through efficient resource allocation. Uncovering such regulatory principles informs both our understanding of microbial ecology and provides inspiration for synthetic biology efforts to engineer analogous gene circuits.","type":"content","url":"/ch26#the-tryptophanase-operon","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"26.

These loops allow cells to maintain optimal levels of enzymes, metabolites, and proteins by repressing expression when concentrations become too high. The tryptophan operon exemplifies this through attenuation and repression by TrpR.\n\nGene regulation frequently integrates multiple signals and inputs, allowing cells to make sophisticated decisions. The tryptophanase operon is regulated by both tryptophanand glucose levels, prioritizing the most efficient carbon source.\n\nRegulatory systems often employ multiple layered mechanisms like transcriptional, translational, and metabolic control for finer-tuned expression. The tryptophan operon uses repression, attenuation, and enzyme inhibition in concert.\n\nThe intricate interplay between regulatory DNA sequences, transcription factors, small molecules, and cooperative binding enables cells to deploy complex regulatory strategies tailored to their specific needs. However, many questions remain about how these systems evolved, how they adapt to changing environments, and how dysregulation contributes to disease.\n\nAs synthetic biology and genome engineering advance, understanding natural gene regulation will be invaluable for rationally designing novel genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, and cellular behaviors. Additionally, comprehensive mapping of regulatory networks will shed light on systems-level properties governing cellular decision-making.\n\nUltimately, gene regulation represents a central layer of control that allows the remarkably robust and adaptive behavior of living systems to emerge from a finite set of genetic instructions.

The second, the tryptophanase (tna) operon, features positive feedback and can exhibit bistability, explaining how heterogeneous expression and bet‑hedging arise in bacterial populations.\n\nOur goal is to link mathematical behavior (steady states, stability, bifurcations, and timescales) to biological function and intuition, and to provide exercises that let the reader explore these phenomena analytically and numerically.","type":"content","url":"/ch27#introduction","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"27.

Mathematical Modelling of Simple BacterialGene Regulatory Networks","lvl2":"General Model Development"},"content":"Gene expression is a complex process involving numerous chemical reactions at each step of transcription and translation. However, we can build a simple model based on the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nConsider a basic operon whose genes code for an enzyme E that catalyzes the synthesis of a metabolite P. The synthesis of the operon’s mRNA, M, via transcription is feedback-regulated by P. Additionally, the activity of the E enzymes may also be feedback-regulated by P. With these considerations, the dynamics of M, E, and P are governed by the following ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{M} &= k_M f(P) - \\gamma_M M, \\\\\n\\dot{E} &= k_E M - \\gamma_E E,\\\\\n\\dot{P} &= k_P g(P) E - \\gamma_P P,.\n\\end{align*}\n\nHere, k_M represents the maximum transcription initiation rate, \\gamma_M is the rate constant for mRNA degradation, k_E denotes the translation initiation rate, \\gamma_E is the rate constant for enzyme degradation, k_P is the maximum metabolite synthesis rate per enzyme molecule, and \\gamma_P is the rate constant for metabolite degradation. The functions f(P) and g(P) denote feedback regulation in terms of metabolite concentration. f(P) can be interpreted as the probability that the promoter is not repressed, while g(P) represents the fraction of un-inhibited enzyme molecules. These functions are decreasing (increasing) functions of P in case of negative (positive) feedback regulation.\n\nThe functions f(P) and g(P) take values in the interval [0, 1] as they can be understood as probabilities. f(P) is the probability that the mRNA polymerase binding site is not blocked by a repressor molecule, which depends on the amount of active repressor molecules. Depending on the system, repressor molecules are active when they are free from or bound by specific metabolites. In summary, transcriptional repression can be reduced to a, more or less intricate, ligand-receptor interaction. Thus, based on the results in Chapter \n\n24, the function f(P) can be approximated by a growing or decreasing Hill function, depending on whether it accounts for positive or negative feedback regulation:f(P)=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(K_f^{n_f}+P^{n_f})\\pm(K_f^{n_f}-P^{n_f})}{K_f^{n_f}+P^{n_f}}.\n\nIn the equation above, K_f is the half-saturation constant (f(K_f)=1/2), and n_f \\geq 1 is the so-called Hill exponent. It measures the sigmoidicity of the Hill function. When n_f=1, the function f(P) becomes a Michaelis-Menten equation, whereas it approaches a step function when n_f \\to \\infty. The sign + (-) is chosen to account for negative (positive) regulation.\n\nEnzymes are often inhibited or activated when they are bound by specific metabolites. Thus, enzyme inhibition can also be reduced to a ligand-receptor problem, and the function g(P) can be approximated by a Hill function:g(P)=\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(K_g^{n_g}+P^{n_g})\\pm(K_g^{n_g}-P^{n_g})}{K_g^{n_g}+P^{n_g}}.","type":"content","url":"/ch27#general-model-development","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"27.

Mathematical Modelling of Simple BacterialGene Regulatory Networks","lvl2":"The Tryptophan Operon"},"content":"A specific model for the tryptophan operon, discussed in the previous chapter, can be derived from our general model as follows:\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{M} &= k_M f(W) - \\gamma_M M, \\\\\n\\dot{E} &= k_E M - \\gamma_E E,\\\\\n\\dot{W} &= k_W g(W) E - \\gamma_W W, \n\\end{align*}\n\nwith\\begin{align*}\nf(W)&=\\frac{K_M^{n_M}}{K_M^{n_M}+W^{n_M}},\\\\\ng(W)&=\\frac{K_W^{n_W}}{K_E^{n_W}+E^{n_W}}.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn these equations, T represents the intracellular concentration of tryptophan, the amino acid produced by the tryptophan operon. E denotes the concentration of the enzyme anthranilate synthase, a tetrameric protein composed of two peptides resulting from the expression of the first gene (trpE) and two peptides from the second gene (trpD) of the tryptophan operon. Anthranilate synthase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in tryptophan biosynthesis, and its activity is feedback-regulated by the end product, tryptophan.\n\nThe first equation describes the dynamics of mRNA concentration, where k_M is the maximum rate of mRNA synthesis, K_M is the half-saturation constant for tryptophan’s negative feedback on gene transcription, and n_M is the Hill coefficient governing the cooperativity of this feedback regulation.\n\nThe second equation models anthranilate synthase dynamics. k_E is the enzyme synthesis rate per mRNA molecule and \\gamma_M is the rate constant for enzyme degradation.\n\nThe third equation models the dynamics of tryptophan concentration, where k_T is the maximum rate of tryptophan synthesis, K_T is the half-saturation constant for tryptophan’s negative feedback on its own synthesis, n_T is the corresponding Hill coefficient, and \\gamma_T is the rate constant for tryptophan degradation or consumption.\n\nThis model captures the essential features of the tryptophan operon, including the multi-layered negative feedback regulation mechanisms employed to control tryptophan biosynthesis. Firstly, the transcription of the operon is negatively regulated by tryptophan through two distinct mechanisms: repression and transcriptional attenuation, both of which are accounted for by a single regulatory function. Secondly, the activity of the key enzyme anthranilate synthase is directly inhibited by tryptophan through allosteric regulation.\n\nOne of the first questions that arises is the reason for redundant negative feedback mechanisms in the tryptophan operon system. We address this question by analyzing the stability of the system’s steady states. But first, it convenient to simplify the model.\n\nAccording to \n\nSantillán & Zeron (2004), the half-life of mRNA is about one minute, while that of anthranilate synthase is a few hours, and that of tryptophan is a few seconds. This suggests that mRNA and tryptophan have much faster dynamics than anthranilate synthase. Therefore, we can make quasi-steady-state approximations for M and T.\n\nFrom the condition \\dot{M}=0, we get:M = \\frac{k_M}{\\gamma_M} f(T),\n\nOn the other hand, the condition \\dot{T}=0 implies:E = h(T)=\\frac{\\gamma_T}{k_T} \\frac{T}{g(T)}.\n\nSince g(T) is a continuous decreasing function of T, representing the negative feedback regulation of enzyme activity by tryptophan, h(T) is a continuous growing function that can be inverted to give:T= h^{-1}(E).\n\nSubstituting Eqs. \n\n(6) and \n\n(8) into the equation for \\dot{E} (Eq. \n\n(4)), we obtain a reduced model that ignores the rapid transients of M and T and focuses on the slow dynamics of E:\\dot{E} = \\frac{k_M k_E}{\\gamma_M} f(h^{-1}(E)) - \\gamma_E E.\n\nThe value of E at the steady states can be computed from the condition \\dot{E}=0, which yields:E = \\frac{k_M k_E}{\\gamma_M \\gamma_E} f(h^{-1}(E)).\n\nThe left-hand side of this equation is the 45-degree diagonal straight line, while the right-hand side is a continuously decreasing function of E that is greater than zero at E=0. It can be proven from these facts that the two curves intersect at a single point, implying that our model has only one steady state given by the solution of Eq. \n\n(10). The steady-state values of M and T can then be obtained by substituting the stationary value of E into Eqs. \n\n(6) and \n\n(8), respectively.\n\nThe stability of the steady state is determined by the derivative of the right-hand side of Eq. \n\n(9). After some algebraic manipulation, it can be shown that this derivative is given by the following expression:\\rho = \\gamma_E  \\left( T_{max} \\frac{f'(T^*) g^2(T^*)}{g(T^*)-T^* g'(T^*)} - 1\\right),\n\nwhereT_{max}=\\frac{k_M k_E k_T}{\\gamma_M \\gamma_E \\gamma_T}\n\nis the theoretical upper bound for the intracellular tryptophan concentration.\n\nNote that \\rho < 0 since f'(T^*), g'(T^*) < 0, implying that the steady state is locally stable. On the other hand, -\\gamma_E is the upper bound of \\rho, which is achieved when f'(T^*) = 0. This indicates that transcriptional regulation plays a fundamental role in accelerating the system’s response after a perturbation from the steady state. Notably, repression and transcriptional attenuation achieve maximal sensitivity at quite different tryptophan levels; repression at about T^* and transcriptional attenuation one order of magnitude below T^* \n\nSantillán & Zeron (2004). This may ensure a rapid response over a wide range of tryptophan concentrations.\n\nRegarding enzyme inhibition, observe in Eq. \n\n(11) that \\rho increases (becomes less negative) as g(T^*) decreases. Thus, this regulatory mechanism slows down the system’s response instead of accelerating it. Interestingly, the dissociation constant for the binding of tryptophan to anthranilate synthase is one order of magnitude smaller than T^*, implying that g(T^*) \\approx 0 because enzyme inhibition is in the saturation regime at the steady state \n\nSantillán & Zeron (2004). This indicates that enzyme inhibition plays an energetic rather than a dynamical role. By releasing inhibited enzymes, it ensures an efficient response when tryptophan levels are very low, without having to wait for more enzymes to be synthesized.","type":"content","url":"/ch27#the-tryptophan-operon","position":7},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"27.

Mathematical Modelling of Simple BacterialGene Regulatory Networks","lvl2":"The Tryptophanase Operon"},"content":"A simple mathematical model that captures the key regulatory features of the tryptophanase operon can be written as follows:\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{P}&=k_P(G_E) \\frac{W^n}{W^n+K_P^n}-\\mu_P P,\\\\\n\\dot{W}&=k_W(W_E) P-\\gamma_W P W-\\mu_W W.\n\\end{align*}\n\nIn these equations, P denotes the level of the tryptophanase operon proteins (TnaA and TnaB), while W represents the intracellular tryptophan concentration. The parameter k_P(G_E) is the maximum transcription rate of the operon, which is negatively regulated by external glucose G_E via catabolite repression. The Hill function \\frac{W^n}{W^n+K_P^n} accounts for the positive regulation of transcription by intracellular tryptophan W (mediated by inactivation of the \\rho terminator). The term \\mu_P P represents protein degradation and dilution due to cell growth. The rate of tryptophan uptake is given by k_W(W_E) P, where k_W(W_E) is an increasing function of the external tryptophan level W_E, reflecting the role of TnaB as a tryptophan permease. The term \\gamma_W P W is the rate at which intracellular tryptophan is metabolized by the TnaA enzyme. Finally, \\mu_W W accounts for tryptophan consumption by other processes like protein synthesis and dilution by growth.\n\nTo simplify the analysis, we assume the tryptophan metabolism flux \\gamma_W P W is much smaller than the other tryptophan consumption terms (\\mu_W W). This yields the reduced model:\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{P}&=k_P(G_E) \\frac{W^n}{W^n+K_P^n}-\\mu_P P,\\\\\n\\dot{W}&=k_W(W_E) P -\\mu_W W.\n\\end{align*}\n\nBy introducing the dimensionless variables p = P/\\left(k_P(G_E)/\\mu_P\\right), w = W/\\left(k_P k_W/(\\mu_P \\mu_W)\\right), t' = \\mu_P t, and defining \\mu = \\mu_W/\\mu_P, K(G_E,W_E) = K_P(G_E) \\mu_P\\mu_W/(k_P(G_E) k_W(W_E)), the model becomes:\\begin{align*}\n\\dot{p}&=\\frac{w^n}{w^n+K^n(G_E,W_E)}-p, \\\\\n\\dot{w}&=\\mu\\left( p - w \\right). \n\\end{align*}\n\nNote that K(G_E,W_E) increases with G_E (repressing operon expression) and decreases with W_E (enhancing expression).\n\nTo find steady states, we set \\dot{p}=\\dot{w}=0, yielding:p=\\frac{w^n}{w^n+K^n(G_E,W_E)}, \\quad w=p.\n\nThus, the steady-state values of p satisfy:p = \\frac{p^n}{p^n + K^n(G_E,W_E)}.\n\nGraphical analysis (Fig.   \n\nFigure 1) reveals that for large K, this equation has a single solution p=0 (no expression). As K decreases, two additional steady states emerge via a saddle-node bifurcation: an intermediate state and a high expression state near p=1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1:Intersection of the identity line y = p and Hill functions (n = 3) varying K.\n\nTo study stability, we compute the Jacobian matrix:J =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1 & H'\\left(w\\right) \\\\\n\\mu & -\\mu\n\\end{bmatrix}\n,\n\nwhere H'(w) = d/dw \\left(w^n/(w^n+K^n)\\right) is the derivative of the Hill function. The trace \\tau = -(1+\\mu) is negative, while the determinant is \\Delta = \\mu(1-H'(w)). zThus, a steady state is stable if \\Delta > 0, i.e. H'(w^*) < 1 at the steady state w^*.  Since the sigmoidal curve w(p) has a slope less than 1 at the low and high stable states, these are stable nodes. However, the intermediate state has H'(w^*)>1, making it an unstable saddle point.\n\nIn summary, the tryptophanase operon can exhibit bistable expression dynamics when tryptophan and glucose levels permit it. In bacterial populations, gene expression is not uniform; instead, it exhibits a phenomenon known as biochemical noise. In the presence of bistability, this variability can lead to some individual bacteria expressing genes at low rates (corresponding to the low-expression steady state) while others express them at high rates (corresponding to the high expression steady state). This heterogeneity can be particularly advantageous for bacterial populations facing rapidly changing environments as it can facilitate a form of bet-hedging, where the population as a whole can respond more flexibly to environmental shifts. For instance, if a sudden change in the environment favors a particular metabolic pathway, those bacteria with higher expression levels of the relevant genes are more likely to thrive. At the same time, the presence of low-expressing cells ensures that not all members are similarly affected by deleterious environmental changes, thereby providing a reservoir of potential adaptability. This dynamic interplay of expression levels, driven by biochemical noise, underscores the importance of gene regulatory networks, such as the tryptophanase operon, in enabling bacterial populations to swiftly adapt to their surroundings.","type":"content","url":"/ch27#the-tryptophanase-operon","position":9},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"27.
