The sage said that he only wanted a small amount of rice, but the amount had to be calculated using the chessboard. A grain of rice would be placed in the first square and the number of rice grains would double for each successive square on the board. The king lost the game and had to give the sage the rice. But as he started putting the rice grains on the board, the king realized that he wouldn’t have enough rice to pay his debt. Krishna then showed himself in his true form and told the king that he didn’t have to pay all the rice right away, but he could do it gradually. Every day, the king would serve free rice pudding to people who came to the temple until the debt was paid off.","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"wQMuntqOEu"}],"key":"vhJEEIHq1g"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":11,"column":1},"end":{"line":11,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This story has different versions.
