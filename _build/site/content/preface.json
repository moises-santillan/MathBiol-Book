We start with population dynamics because its concepts are intuitive to students from the exact sciences, and then broaden the canvas to topics such as electrophysiology and chemical kinetics to demonstrate the wide applicability of the same mathematical techniques. This structure is intended to build intuition alongside technical skill—students learn why a model is useful before learning how to build it.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"Jliyb1ZgSi"}],"key":"xioKkMgyI2"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I have also included short historical perspectives and vignettes about the development of key ideas.
