We begin by examining the mechanistic “clockwork” worldview of the Enlightenment, which sought to reduce life to a series of physical levers and chemical reactions. We then analyze the Vitalist response—exemplified by the “animating spark” in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein—which argued that living organisms possess a unique, holistic integrity that resists mechanistic reduction. While the discovery of DNA and the synthesis of urea eventually debunked the notion of a non-physical “vital force,” we argue that the Vitalist intuition survives in the contemporary study of emergent properties. By bridging the gap between Romantic holism and non-linear mathematics, this chapter demonstrates how Complexity Science provides a rigorous framework for understanding life as an emergent state of matter, effectively resurrecting the “wholeness” of Vitalism through the lens of self-organizing systems.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"TIbLXoOIax"}],"key":"Jqq2DnbNcY"},{"type":"heading","depth":3,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"EMhKJ5322d"}],"identifier":"introduction","label":"Introduction","html_id":"introduction","implicit":true,"key":"mrPF3kKFug"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"emphasis","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1},"end":{"line":9,"column":1}},"key":"HR20elQV8l"}],"key":"YI2xjLeVvf"},{"type":"text","value":", the nineteenth century novel by Mary Shelley, visually encapsulates the scientific anxieties of the nineteenth century.
