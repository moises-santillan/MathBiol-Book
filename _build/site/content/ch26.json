We trace the lineage of the gene from its rediscovery as a Mendelian abstraction to its physical localization on chromosomes by the Morgan School, and finally to its chemical identification as DNA by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty. The narrative explores the tension and eventual synthesis between two burgeoning schools of thought: the Structural School, which utilized X-ray crystallography to visualize the architecture of macromolecules, and the Informational School, which applied quantum mechanical intuition to treat the gene as a “code-script.” We also highlight the critical, often independent contributions of French researchers to gene regulation and enzymatic control. This cross-disciplinary dialogue—bridging physics, chemistry, and genetics—culminated in the 1953 determination of the DNA double helix. By unifying biological function with molecular structure, this milestone provided the mechanistic basis for heredity and established molecular biology as the primary framework for modern life sciences.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"pfgaVJPlER"}],"key":"qvyyHjDyzZ"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"JUMG29l0P0"}],"identifier":"introduction","label":"Introduction","html_id":"introduction","implicit":true,"key":"Voa0xVCQms"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The origins of molecular biology can be traced back to the rediscovery and synthesis of Gregor Mendel’s work on inheritance at the turn of the 20th century.
