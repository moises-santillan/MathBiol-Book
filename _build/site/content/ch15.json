Scaling relationships govern how structures like bones evolve in proportion to size to cope with mechanics. Metabolic rates also scale predictably with mass to maintain homeostasis across magnitudes. Evolution enforces proportional tuning of all traits through natural selection. Together, these multi-level scaling constraints reveal why artificially modifying size alone produces non-viable designs. Popular scenarios of miniaturization/magnification in films disregard life’s exquisitely calibrated, scaled architecture. Mathematical modeling faces challenges representing biology’s polyscalar complexity across organizational levels from molecules to ecosystems. Studying scaling laws provides perspectives on what engineered modifications respect life’s constraints and informs authentic portrayals in storytelling by highlighting the intrinsically scaled nature of life.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"eaAxZviRTz"}],"key":"UjeL9KpApl"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"TcANsaGk5o"}],"identifier":"introduction","label":"Introduction","html_id":"introduction","implicit":true,"key":"hc2epGReRb"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"For decades, science fiction films have entertained audiences with fantastical scenarios of humans and animals transformed to novel sizes.
