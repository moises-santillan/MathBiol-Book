Pioneering genetics experiments suggested genes reside on chromosomes and have a physical nature, while subsequent discoveries identified DNA as the hereditary material and elucidated its double-helical structure. French scientists also made important independent findings in areas like gene regulation and restriction enzymes. Though initially dominated by separate structural and informational schools applying techniques like X-ray crystallography and quantum genetics, collaboration between thinkers such as Pauling, Astbury, Bernal, Morgan, Muller, Avery, Delbrück, Lwoff, Monod, Jacob, Watson, Crick, Wilkins and Franklin gradually decoded life’s processes at the intricately coded molecular level. Their diverse lines of investigation across disciplines ultimately culminated in Watson and Crick’s 1953 determination of DNA’s double-helical architecture, unifying molecular genetics through physical principles and launching the independent field of modern molecular biology.","position":{"start":{"line":5,"column":1},"end":{"line":5,"column":1}},"key":"EhGGSs56j7"}],"key":"kJJmpuD2ay"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Introduction","position":{"start":{"line":7,"column":1},"end":{"line":7,"column":1}},"key":"H0PFtzHrAk"}],"identifier":"introduction","label":"Introduction","html_id":"introduction","implicit":true,"key":"yUvQVNIAJK"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1},"end":{"line":8,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The origins of molecular biology can be traced back to the rediscovery and synthesis of Gregor Mendel’s work on inheritance at the turn of the 20th century.
